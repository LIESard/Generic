2015-01-27 21:30:48	liesard	Yeah, that didn't work out so well
2015-01-27 21:31:01	liesard	My font supports unicode so it's definitely your fault ;D
2015-01-27 21:32:04	xnil	yep

2015-01-27 21:34:01	liesard	Ok, cool
2015-01-27 21:34:07	xnil	lol
2015-01-27 21:34:11	xnil	got any questions?
2015-01-27 21:34:13	liesard	'cause I'm writing a brainfuck interpreter, but I don't know how to output the thingy in Unicode
2015-01-27 21:34:18	liesard	Yeah, that ^
2015-01-27 21:34:18	xnil	uh
2015-01-27 21:34:20	xnil	um
2015-01-27 21:34:26	liesard	Like
2015-01-27 21:34:31	liesard	Brainfuck is all one array
2015-01-27 21:34:39	xnil	the tape is an array
2015-01-27 21:34:44	liesard	Yeah
2015-01-27 21:34:52	liesard	And the value of each thingy is a char
2015-01-27 21:34:58	liesard	But the char is in unicode
2015-01-27 21:35:00	xnil	you want it to go to STDOUT as unicode?
2015-01-27 21:35:03	liesard	Yes.
2015-01-27 21:35:04	liesard	That.
2015-01-27 21:35:32	xnil	what are the datatypes of the tape cells
2015-01-27 21:35:47	liesard	Well the array is an int
2015-01-27 21:35:53	liesard	And the user input is a char pointer
2015-01-27 21:36:17	xnil	so it's an int pointer
2015-01-27 21:36:18	liesard	omg I think I get it
2015-01-27 21:36:19	liesard	Hold on
2015-01-27 21:36:19	xnil	the array, is
2015-01-27 21:36:22	liesard	Yeah
2015-01-27 21:36:24	xnil	:)
2015-01-27 21:36:51	@dymatic	liesard: Did you read any encoding tutorials?
2015-01-27 21:36:56	liesard	dymatic: Nope ;D
2015-01-27 21:36:59	liesard	xnil: segfault
2015-01-27 21:37:00	liesard	Hold on, brb
2015-01-27 21:37:05	xnil	use rust l o l
2015-01-27 21:37:15	xnil	segfaults r impossible
2015-01-27 21:37:41	@dymatic	Also, what xnil said. I'd rather wrestle the borrow checker than wrestle gdb any day.
2015-01-27 21:37:41	xnil	liesard: if you're interested, i've got a superset of brainfuck i made a long time ago that could be interesting to implement
2015-01-27 21:39:17	liesard	Back
2015-01-27 21:39:19	liesard	Oh, damn
2015-01-27 21:39:27	liesard	xnil: Uhh, sure...?
2015-01-27 21:39:30	liesard	I'll take a look
2015-01-27 21:40:56	xnil	https://github.com/cdh473/mrboon/wiki/Boonfuck
2015-01-27 21:41:17	liesard	Thanks!
2015-01-27 21:41:27	xnil	or if you're interested in writing interpreters i might suggest making a Lisp interpreter
2015-01-27 21:41:52	liesard	Nah, I just want to mess around with C :P

2015-01-27 22:45:28	@dymatic	Rust is C-style. And no more memory errors.
2015-01-27 22:45:39	liesard	It's kinda C-style
2015-01-27 22:45:50	liesard	But with a few differences which I can't seem to get used to
2015-01-27 22:46:22	@dymatic	Then I'd recommend messing about in gdb. It's a debugger. So you can see exactly where your program segfaults, examine local variables, and stuff like that.
2015-01-27 22:46:33	liesard	Ok...

2015-01-27 22:49:47	@dymatic	Actually, if you use Code::blocks for C dev, it shows you the line of code where it segfaults right in the IDE.

2015-01-27 22:52:36	@dymatic	So good.
2015-01-27 22:52:36	liesard	I enjoy using Sublime Text+cc
2015-01-27 22:52:44	xnil	i'm a vim/emacs man
2015-01-27 22:52:48	@dymatic	Emacs for life
2015-01-27 22:52:54	@dymatic	Vim has its place, too.
2015-01-27 22:53:09	xnil	emacs is mostly for lisps in my usage
2015-01-27 22:53:30	@dymatic	I like Emacs for any interpretted language.
2015-01-27 22:53:34	liesard	I use vi for quick edits
2015-01-27 22:53:36	@dymatic	Python, Haskell, etc.
2015-01-27 22:53:46	@dymatic	vim for configs. But I've aliased vim to emacs -nw lately.
2015-01-27 22:54:40	liesard	What does emacs -nw do?
2015-01-27 22:54:46	@dymatic	Opens a terminal emacs.
2015-01-27 22:54:48	xnil	liesard: terminal
2015-01-27 22:54:49	@dymatic	-nw = no window
2015-01-27 22:55:04	liesard	omg
2015-01-27 22:55:09	liesard	This changes everything
2015-01-27 22:55:11	xnil	eh, i use dwm so i'm fine using vim in interpreted languages, though i respect the want to have the experience super integrated
2015-01-27 22:55:53	@dymatic	liesard: I'm kind of lost as to what your source is doing.
2015-01-27 22:56:07	liesard	dymatic: Uhh...
2015-01-27 22:56:10	liesard	How so?
2015-01-27 22:56:30	@dymatic	So, you loop through a hundred times.
2015-01-27 22:56:50	@dymatic	And use input[i]. Is your input a hundred characters?
2015-01-27 22:57:18	@dymatic	If it's less than a hundred character that's where your segfault is.
2015-01-27 22:58:52	liesard	dymatic: Oh shit
2015-01-27 22:58:53	liesard	Really?
2015-01-27 22:58:59	liesard	I didn't manage to get the array size though
2015-01-27 22:59:32	@dymatic	It won't if you malloced it big enough.
2015-01-27 23:00:23	liesard	Well that was when I was using the char array
2015-01-27 23:00:39	liesard	I'll try again
2015-01-27 23:05:17	liesard	Ugh, so many chats to follow
2015-01-27 23:05:21	liesard	Not enough time to fix my code
2015-01-27 23:06:50	liesard	Ugh, I keep getting segfaults
2015-01-27 23:09:15	@dymatic	I'm kind of repairing the code atm
2015-01-27 23:10:27	liesard	:O
2015-01-27 23:10:34	liesard	Thank you!
2015-01-27 23:11:44	@dymatic	Ugh
2015-01-27 23:11:52	@dymatic	I love when F.lux changes the hue.
2015-01-27 23:11:55	@dymatic	It's such a cool feeling.

2015-01-27 23:21:07	&anshin	so far I have nothing
2015-01-27 23:21:26	@dymatic	liesard: Yeah, this is some troublesome stuff.
2015-01-27 23:21:43	@dymatic	I'm not sure what determines the default terminal.
2015-01-27 23:21:49	@dymatic	Something in...dconf editor should be able to change it?
2015-01-27 23:21:58	&anshin	I looked but I haven't found anything
2015-01-27 23:22:23	liesard	anshin: What wm?
2015-01-27 23:22:27	&anshin	gala
2015-01-27 23:22:43	liesard	Oh, I have no idea
2015-01-27 23:22:46	liesard	Sorry :P
2015-01-27 23:22:48	&anshin	just found it
2015-01-27 23:22:50	xenkey	anshin: $TERM ?
2015-01-27 23:22:54	&anshin	sort of.
2015-01-27 23:23:01	liesard	dymatic: Good luck with that~
2015-01-27 23:23:21	&anshin	x-terminal-emulator should run whatever is currently the default, but Super+t didn't run anything
2015-01-27 23:23:49	&anshin	but I found org > gnome > desktop > applications > terminal
2015-01-27 23:24:05	@dymatic	What terminal is running as default right now?
2015-01-27 23:24:07	&anshin	changing that from x-terminal-emulator to my chosen terminal worked, but I'm pretty sure that's not the elegant solution
2015-01-27 23:24:17	&anshin	pantheon-terminal, but I purged it
2015-01-27 23:24:20	@dymatic	I did get my rust version of your code to compile liesard https://www.refheap.com/96560
2015-01-27 23:24:32	@dymatic	anshin: Reinstall it, and change the pantheon-terminal binary to your terminal's binary.
2015-01-27 23:24:36	@dymatic	Ugly hack...
2015-01-27 23:24:38	@dymatic	But fuck it, it'd work.
2015-01-27 23:24:48	&anshin	my other (slightly less ugly) hack worked
2015-01-27 23:24:49	liesard	dymatic: Hahaha
2015-01-27 23:24:51	&anshin	so I'm going to stick with it
2015-01-27 23:24:58	liesard	Not bad
2015-01-27 23:24:58	@dymatic	I did that with i3 and kwin once to get i3 in kde and nothing broke somehow.
2015-01-27 23:26:06	@dymatic	So, writing rust for the first time in about two months was interesting.
2015-01-27 23:26:14	@dymatic	Strings are a fucking mess still.
2015-01-27 23:26:47	liesard	Yeah, I heard they were different ;P
2015-01-27 23:26:49	liesard	*:P
2015-01-27 23:27:19	@dymatic	I mean... I could go on a Linus-Torvalds esque rant about this shit.
2015-01-27 23:28:16	@dymatic	You have String, which is well and good. But then some shit wants &[u8], k. &[char] is actually pretty hard to get, because you have to coerce String.chars() into it through like three methods (since it returns an ugly fucking Chars trait)
2015-01-27 23:29:13	@dymatic	And before you know it your functions are taking &Vec<&Chars<'r, T>> and you wonder why Java isn't good enough for what you're doing.
2015-01-27 23:29:14	&anshin	that should improve throughout the alpha right?
2015-01-27 23:29:20	@dymatic	I'd hope.
2015-01-27 23:29:25	&anshin	good
2015-01-27 23:29:31	@dymatic	The standard library is what's going to be changing in alpha.
2015-01-27 23:29:34	&anshin	yeah
2015-01-27 23:29:48	&anshin	being back on urxvt feels so good
2015-01-27 23:30:45	@dymatic	Being "back in Linux" actually feels okay.
2015-01-27 23:31:05	@dymatic	It seems like you're slowly easing out of your want of defaults?
2015-01-27 23:31:10	@dymatic	What with xterm?
2015-01-27 23:31:17	+brkk	http://gfycat.com/ImprobableInconsequentialDungenesscrab
2015-01-27 23:31:18	+brkk	lol
2015-01-27 23:31:35	+brkk	tfw I'm stuck with xfce4-terminal
2015-01-27 23:31:41	@dymatic	Why stuck with it?
2015-01-27 23:31:47	+brkk	cuz I'm lazy
2015-01-27 23:32:08	&anshin	I tried using the default in eOS but I wasn't satisfied with a handful of things (e.g. the cursor) and it was becoming increasingly frustrating
2015-01-27 23:32:13	@dymatic	Liking terminology still.
2015-01-27 23:32:25	@dymatic	I can see that. The terminal is the most important application.
2015-01-27 23:32:31	&anshin	I'm also using neovim in a ppa but it kind of sucks so I might end up compiling vim
2015-01-27 23:32:33	@dymatic	You spend so much time looking into one.
2015-01-27 23:32:36	&anshin	yep
2015-01-27 23:32:47	&anshin	terminal and text editor
2015-01-27 23:32:54	&anshin	everything else is great, aside from battery life
2015-01-27 23:32:59	&anshin	and even it's not too bad

2015-01-29 14:59:36	liesard	Yeah, someone just showed me a debug log

2015-01-29 14:59:52	beelzaboot	you're returning a pointer that's getting cleared after the function ends or something
2015-01-29 14:59:57	beelzaboot	o
2015-01-29 15:00:07	liesard	But that's how it's supposed to be, no?
2015-01-29 15:00:17	beelzaboot	no make input an argument
2015-01-29 15:00:21	beelzaboot	malloc it outside of the function

2015-01-29 15:04:06	beelzaboot	oh ok
2015-01-29 15:04:16	beelzaboot	yeah most of them are going to be empty string

2015-01-29 15:04:33	liesard	Ok
2015-01-29 15:04:43	liesard	Ooh, a hyphen
2015-01-29 15:04:50	liesard	Wait, but it shouldn't take this long
2015-01-29 15:05:09	liesard	Like, it should be ~2 before it gets to actual characters
2015-01-29 15:06:58	liesard	Also, it's leaking memory
2015-01-29 15:07:02	liesard	I should do free() right?
2015-01-29 15:07:52	beelzaboot	as in it's slow to run?
2015-01-29 15:07:59	beelzaboot	and nah you don't technically need to in this case
2015-01-29 15:08:05	liesard	Oh, Ok
2015-01-29 15:08:08	beelzaboot	but you should for good habit ig 
2015-01-29 15:08:11	liesard	It's just what valgrind says
2015-01-29 15:08:17	beelzaboot	yeah
2015-01-29 15:08:40	beelzaboot	it's not a leak though
2015-01-29 15:09:29	liesard	Oh, Ok
2015-01-29 15:10:16	liesard	I feel like such a pro
2015-01-29 15:10:20	liesard	Going through debug logs and such
2015-01-29 15:12:50	liesard	Wait, so what was wrong with the userInput function?
2015-01-29 15:13:04	liesard	'cause I thought that was how you were supposed to handle pointers and stuff
2015-01-29 15:17:42	beelzaboot	liesard: well you'd allocate input within the function
2015-01-29 15:17:44	beelzaboot	(the stack)
2015-01-29 15:17:51	beelzaboot	and then after it returns
2015-01-29 15:17:54	beelzaboot	it's garbage data
2015-01-29 15:18:20	liesard	Yeah, but the pointer's value is the value that gets returned
2015-01-29 15:18:26	liesard	Right?
2015-01-29 15:18:49	beelzaboot	the return value was a pointer
2015-01-29 15:18:56	liesard	Yeah
2015-01-29 15:19:05	liesard	Ok, the pointer becomes the value that got returned
2015-01-29 15:19:45	beelzaboot	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7754986/returning-pointer-from-a-function here r some better explanations
2015-01-29 15:19:54	liesard	Thanks!
2015-01-29 15:20:31	beelzaboot	ive heard calling malloc from within a function could be considered harmful tho so should take it in as an argument instead
2015-01-29 15:20:44	liesard	Ah, Ok
2015-01-29 15:20:58	liesard	The memory gets freed when the program exits, right?
2015-01-29 15:21:50	beelzaboot	yeah
2015-01-29 15:22:18	liesard	So calling free is almost never necessary
2015-01-29 15:22:39	beelzaboot	well it is if you're dynamically using malloc
2015-01-29 15:22:54	liesard	What does that mean?
2015-01-29 15:25:09	beelzaboot	if you're calling multiple mallocs like responding to user input or something
2015-01-29 15:25:24	liesard	Ah, right
2015-01-29 15:25:30	liesard	Makes sense, yeah
2015-01-29 15:27:59	liesard	But say I didn't call malloc in the userInput function
2015-01-29 15:28:03	liesard	Would it still be Ok?
2015-01-29 15:31:17	beelzaboot	from what liesard
