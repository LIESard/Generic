2015-01-27 19:34:31	liesard	Ok back
2015-01-27 19:34:35	liesard	Normally this should work
2015-01-27 19:34:44	xero	so at my current job i'm a bug buster. i use jira all day. and it's the worst bloated thing i've ever used.
2015-01-27 19:34:44	+z3bra	he seems to do like 10,000 different things at a time
2015-01-27 19:34:55	+z3bra	xero, I use jira too
2015-01-27 19:35:00	thetornainbow	haha
2015-01-27 19:35:08	thetornainbow	i know that feeling sometim
2015-01-27 19:35:09	+z3bra	as a sysadmin
2015-01-27 19:35:19	+z3bra	I'm damn happy we have something like this to track our work
2015-01-27 19:35:40	+z3bra	it helps us communicte with our clients
2015-01-27 19:35:44	+z3bra	have them report bugs
2015-01-27 19:35:45	xero	me too, but i feel like people get more into the philosophy of tracking work than actually doing it.
2015-01-27 19:36:07	+z3bra	mmh, maybe
2015-01-27 19:36:10	+z3bra	the thing is
2015-01-27 19:36:16	thetornainbow	we just got a new tracking system, and sometimes i wonder if the people who are writing it actually use it
2015-01-27 19:36:19	thetornainbow	it's miserable
2015-01-27 19:36:26	+z3bra	with jira, I've found it's easier to remember what has been done
2015-01-27 19:36:33	+z3bra	when people ask me 
2015-01-27 19:36:44	+z3bra	"Hey, have you open the firewall for client XXX ?"
2015-01-27 19:36:53	+z3bra	"Is there a jira for it ?"
2015-01-27 19:37:03	+z3bra	Yes -> I can check wether it's closed or not
2015-01-27 19:37:11	+z3bra	No -> Then no, make a jira, and I'll do it
2015-01-27 19:37:14	+z3bra	simple.
2015-01-27 19:37:15	thetornainbow	No ticket == No touchit
2015-01-27 19:37:17	+z3bra	^
2015-01-27 19:37:22	xero	yeah, i see that. but i'm a coder not a sysadmin. so i do all that in my github PR's. 
2015-01-27 19:37:34	+z3bra	you use github at work ?
2015-01-27 19:37:38	xero	i just want bugs assigned to me so i can fix them.
2015-01-27 19:37:40	xero	yes, all day
2015-01-27 19:37:43	+z3bra	awesome :)
2015-01-27 19:37:45	+z3bra	We don't
2015-01-27 19:37:47	xero	indeed
2015-01-27 19:37:50	xero	im sorry
2015-01-27 19:38:03	+z3bra	so yeah; with github's issue tracking, having jira is way too redundant
2015-01-27 19:38:23	+z3bra	We use gitlab + jira here
2015-01-27 19:38:24	xero	yup. i just read the client's notes on the issue and log my time.
2015-01-27 19:38:35	+z3bra	which is the same as github alone in fine
2015-01-27 19:38:50	+z3bra	and you see
2015-01-27 19:38:53	+z3bra	in your example
2015-01-27 19:38:53	xero	but we've written a script that pulls that from jira into github issues, so i've been doing less of the former lately.
2015-01-27 19:38:57	+z3bra	github is bloat :P
2015-01-27 19:39:11	+z3bra	it does the release, versionning and issue tracking :P
2015-01-27 19:39:17	xero	no way, i don't diff code on jira
2015-01-27 19:39:22	+z3bra	While here, we have gitlab for versionning
2015-01-27 19:39:26	+z3bra	jira for issue tracking
2015-01-27 19:39:34	+z3bra	bamboo for releasing
2015-01-27 19:39:49	+z3bra	and sysadmins for the rest :P
2015-01-27 19:40:08	xero	sounds like we both use many products in the the atlassian suite of tools at work
2015-01-27 19:40:26	+z3bra	there must be a reason for it ;)
2015-01-27 19:40:34	+z3bra	I find them pretty nice actually
2015-01-27 19:40:38	+z3bra	anyway
2015-01-27 19:40:42	+z3bra	once you buy their license
2015-01-27 19:40:49	+z3bra	why not use their product ?
2015-01-27 19:40:53	stark	Do you guys know how make ncmpcpp only show the music duration for the currently played music ?
2015-01-27 19:41:05	liesard	stark: What do you mean?
2015-01-27 19:41:06	+z3bra	make the bar invisible
2015-01-27 19:41:09	+z3bra	like
2015-01-27 19:41:14	+z3bra	dark + dark
2015-01-27 19:41:27	stark	Ah

2015-01-27 19:42:49	stark	I still can't figure out how he got that play icon on the now playing
2015-01-27 19:42:53	xero	z3bra: are yours hosted or internal? 
2015-01-27 19:43:04	liesard	stark: Hold on, I think I have the answer
2015-01-27 19:43:05	+z3bra	both
2015-01-27 19:43:12	+z3bra	We run our own clusters
2015-01-27 19:43:24	+z3bra	but we too have hosted servers around the world
2015-01-27 19:43:26	liesard	stark: So open your ncmpcpp config
2015-01-27 19:43:44	+z3bra	stark, but...
2015-01-27 19:43:53	+z3bra	the timebar is shown in this shot
2015-01-27 19:44:11	xero	in the 4 years i've used githbub it's been down 3 times. and in the 8months i've used jura it's been down 10+ times :/
2015-01-27 19:44:35	xero	we just switched to hosting our own jira and it's been a lot better.
2015-01-27 19:44:43	+z3bra	It's my 4th month in the company
2015-01-27 19:44:54	+z3bra	and the server never went down yet

2015-01-27 19:56:47	liesard	That could've been a nickname or something
2015-01-27 19:56:54	+z3bra	z3bra is a nickname
2015-01-27 19:57:05	liesard	True, but still

2015-01-27 19:57:52	liesard	Although Hello World isn't enough for proof
2015-01-27 19:57:57	+z3bra	it is
2015-01-27 19:58:05	liesard	Not really...?
2015-01-27 19:58:22	+z3bra	why not ?
2015-01-27 19:58:28	liesard	Because it's the first thing you learn
2015-01-27 19:58:32	+z3bra	LEARN
2015-01-27 19:58:39	+z3bra	I LEARNT IT
2015-01-27 19:58:43	+z3bra	so I KNOW it
2015-01-27 19:58:48	liesard	I know `print "Hello World"` is Hello World in Perl but I don't know Perl
2015-01-27 19:58:52	xero	i'd say i "know" 9. i use 4. and have some working knownlge of ~15
2015-01-27 19:59:04	liesard	I'm too lazy to count
2015-01-27 19:59:10	liesard	It's probably like 3 or something
2015-01-27 19:59:22	+z3bra	you must be reaaaaaaaaally lazy xD
2015-01-27 19:59:28	liesard	Hahahahaha
2015-01-27 19:59:32	xero	but like when am i ever going to use "m" ?
2015-01-27 19:59:33	+z3bra	"too lazy to count to 3"
2015-01-27 19:59:34	liesard	No, I meant the languages that I /really/ know
2015-01-27 19:59:47	liesard	I mean, I've spent a weekend learning R one time
2015-01-27 19:59:48	+z3bra	lel
2015-01-27 19:59:50	liesard	But I forgot all of it
2015-01-27 20:00:02	liesard	And then there's a bunch of other stuff like BASIC for my calculator and stuff
2015-01-27 20:00:05	liesard	brb
2015-01-27 20:00:05	+z3bra	at which point do you decide wether you know a language or not
2015-01-27 20:00:10	+z3bra	it's up to you to decide
2015-01-27 20:00:16	liesard	True, I guess
2015-01-27 20:00:30	+z3bra	I decided I know a language when I can hello, world
2015-01-27 20:00:49	liesard	I guess that's not unreasonable
2015-01-27 20:01:02	+z3bra	just kidding...
2015-01-27 20:01:13	liesard	Ok...
2015-01-27 20:01:30	+z3bra	you know a language when you can solve simple problems with it
2015-01-27 20:01:34	+z3bra	like
2015-01-27 20:01:35	+z3bra	euler
2015-01-27 20:01:40	liesard	Yes.
2015-01-27 20:01:43	+z3bra	(the first one at least)
2015-01-27 20:01:45	liesard	That should be the universal definition
2015-01-27 20:01:49	xero	i base it on how often i have to look up simple stuff
2015-01-27 20:01:54	+z3bra	but this doesn't apply to every language
2015-01-27 20:02:01	liesard	z3bra: True, yeah
2015-01-27 20:02:05	+z3bra	xero, not reliable :P
2015-01-27 20:02:18	liesard	'cause there are certain languages who can't do those problems
2015-01-27 20:02:22	+z3bra	^
2015-01-27 20:02:29	+z3bra	well
2015-01-27 20:02:29	liesard	For example, SQL
2015-01-27 20:02:30	xero	"z3bra │ it's up to you to decide"
2015-01-27 20:02:41	+z3bra	liesard, SQL is turing complete
2015-01-27 20:02:46	+z3bra	so it CAN do it
2015-01-27 20:02:48	liesard	Oh?
2015-01-27 20:02:50	liesard	I didn't know that
2015-01-27 20:02:58	 *	xero :facepalm:
2015-01-27 20:02:58	liesard	Yeah, but it's not exactly practical
2015-01-27 20:02:59	+z3bra	there one thing, everydayy
2015-01-27 20:03:06	liesard	Yeah
2015-01-27 20:03:08	+z3bra	did not say it would be
2015-01-27 20:03:14	liesard	Although today it was like 5 things
2015-01-27 20:03:15	+z3bra	just that you can do it
2015-01-27 20:03:24	+z3bra	you can do a game of ilfe in brainfuck
2015-01-27 20:03:30	+z3bra	but that's far  from practical
2015-01-27 20:03:47	xero	who is "you" in that case?
2015-01-27 20:03:50	+z3bra	everybody
2015-01-27 20:03:59	+z3bra	brainfuck isn't that hard to learn
2015-01-27 20:04:12	+z3bra	it's just hard to implement simple concepts with it
2015-01-27 20:04:40	+z3bra	but you can add, substract, loop, and conditionnaly jump
2015-01-27 20:04:40	+z3bra	that's far enough
2015-01-27 20:05:01	xero	i spent 2 weeks fighting against the jsfuck exploit (where you write brainfuck in javascript) and it's executed via eval. i wanted to die.
2015-01-27 20:05:10	+z3bra	haha
2015-01-27 20:05:13	+z3bra	yeah
2015-01-27 20:05:28	+z3bra	but brainfuck actually teach you a lot about managing arrays
2015-01-27 20:05:32	+z3bra	(in C, mostly)
2015-01-27 20:05:57	+z3bra	as the whole brainfuck concept is just a char[255] array
2015-01-27 20:06:53	liesard	Yup
2015-01-27 20:07:02	liesard	No, it's char[256]
2015-01-27 20:07:09	liesard	From 0-255
2015-01-27 20:07:36	liesard	But yeah, that's the whole idea
2015-01-27 20:07:48	liesard	In fact, it was thanks to that that I could start making my Brainfuck interpreter
2015-01-27 20:07:55	+z3bra	oh fuck you autist :D
2015-01-27 20:07:59	liesard	>:D
2015-01-27 20:08:07	liesard	I haven't finished it though
2015-01-27 20:08:13	liesard	Scanner messed up
2015-01-27 20:08:18	liesard	I'll try it again but with C next time
2015-01-27 20:10:32	liesard	I guess making an interpreter with Java would let you interpret a language that would be interpreted

2015-01-27 20:22:51	xero	it's just difficult since it's a live site and there are millions of requests. i

2015-01-27 20:23:09	liesard	Damn
2015-01-27 20:23:12	liesard	Do you think you're close?
2015-01-27 20:23:38	xero	kinda. i've found 3 cases where it happens. but i'm not sure why
2015-01-27 20:23:50	xero	each of thoses cases are different requests.

2015-01-27 22:57:37	liesard	So yeah
2015-01-27 22:57:38	liesard	Don't give up
2015-01-27 22:57:45	vypr	I won't
2015-01-27 22:57:48	liesard	:D
2015-01-27 22:57:51	vypr	I just need support
2015-01-27 22:57:55	vypr	Which I'll get from here.
2015-01-27 22:57:59	liesard	\o/
2015-01-27 22:58:01	vypr	Since I've only applied to one online school.
2015-01-27 22:58:09	vypr	Because my mom thinks that applying to more than one is a bad idea.
2015-01-27 22:58:15	liesard	You should just learn by yourself and apply for being a sysadmin or something
2015-01-27 22:58:19	liesard	Or a programmer
2015-01-27 22:58:25	vypr	"You're just like your dad, you see something else and you want it immediately."
2015-01-27 22:58:26	vypr	k
2015-01-27 22:58:30	vypr	I know.
2015-01-27 22:58:37	Andries	Wow
2015-01-27 22:58:38	liesard	I think many people are like that
2015-01-27 22:58:46	Andries	Was that a passivr aggressive comment towards your dad
2015-01-27 22:58:49	vypr	Sadly I lost my chances of getting a free CompTIA cert.
2015-01-27 22:58:50	vypr	no
2015-01-27 22:58:54	vypr	my dad doesn't live with me
2015-01-27 22:59:08	vypr	But she's not letting me pursue other options.
2015-01-27 22:59:12	vypr	which doesn't help.
2015-01-27 22:59:18	liesard	What's your main goal?
2015-01-27 22:59:25	vypr	diploma
2015-01-27 22:59:28	vypr	then uni
2015-01-27 22:59:37	Andries	vypr: how exactly is she not letting you?
2015-01-27 22:59:42	vypr	i was gonna explain
2015-01-27 22:59:48	vypr	alright, i applied for one online school.
2015-01-27 22:59:48	Andries	Do you have to pay to apply and stuff?
2015-01-27 22:59:49	vypr	no
2015-01-27 23:00:09	vypr	because my mom didn't want me applying for other schools
2015-01-27 23:00:22	xero	ask your mom what happens if you don't get into the 1st one?
2015-01-27 23:00:24	vypr	i asked "what if this online school doesn't accept me, and the other ones close enrollment"
2015-01-27 23:00:28	vypr	i did
2015-01-27 23:00:30	Andries	...and that stops you from applying... How?
2015-01-27 23:00:31	xero	you gotta have options
2015-01-27 23:00:35	vypr	she said "oh, we'll figure something out then"
2015-01-27 23:00:41	vypr	*sigh*
2015-01-27 23:00:49	xero	backup plans. and if it costs nothing you waste nothing (but time)
2015-01-27 23:00:51	vypr	and she also put me in counseling
2015-01-27 23:01:10	liesard	vypr: Oh god, that sounds terrible
2015-01-27 23:01:18	liesard	You're 17-18, right?
2015-01-27 23:01:23	vypr	16
2015-01-27 23:01:31	liesard	Ah, Ok
2015-01-27 23:01:33	vypr	VLA requires you to go to the building once a week for 5 hours.
2015-01-27 23:01:39	vypr	The rest is purely online.
2015-01-27 23:01:42	liesard	You could go for a job
2015-01-27 23:01:45	vypr	I just want better opportunities.
2015-01-27 23:01:51	liesard	That's true
2015-01-27 23:01:53	vypr	Not really, most places want HS diplomas.
2015-01-27 23:02:00	liesard	Ah, Ok
2015-01-27 23:02:03	liesard	Yeah, that's true
2015-01-27 23:02:03	vypr	Sadly.
2015-01-27 23:02:08	liesard	Unfortunately, yeah
2015-01-27 23:02:11	vypr	My stepdad offered me a summer job.
2015-01-27 23:02:11	Andries	Oh
2015-01-27 23:02:16	vypr	But that's in the summer, sadly.
2015-01-27 23:02:28	Andries	So you need your mother's signature or whatever to apply to online high schools.
2015-01-27 23:02:32	Andries	Aaaah
2015-01-27 23:02:33	Andries	Okok
2015-01-27 23:02:36	vypr	no
2015-01-27 23:02:38	vypr	i just want her approval.
2015-01-27 23:02:40	Andries	.
2015-01-27 23:03:23	vypr	Technically in the end I do probably need her signature or something.
2015-01-27 23:03:28	vypr	Since I'm still a minor.
2015-01-27 23:03:40	xero	when do you start counseling? maybe talk to the counseler about it.
2015-01-27 23:03:46	vypr	i started today
2015-01-27 23:03:50	vypr	but it was an introductory session

2015-01-27 23:05:56	+z3bra	*mind blown*
2015-01-27 23:06:38	vypr	my mom thinks I don't want to go to VLA because I have to go in
2015-01-27 23:06:58	vypr	because the counselor diagnosed me with social anxiety.
2015-01-27 23:06:59	vypr	*sigh*
2015-01-27 23:07:16	vypr	i wish i had more understanding people IRL
2015-01-27 23:07:38	liesard	vypr: It'll get better
2015-01-27 23:07:39	liesard	Don't worry
2015-01-27 23:08:07	vypr	I'm just having a bit of a down moment.
2015-01-27 23:08:19	vypr	Because my mom isn't being how she normally is, and i feel isolated.
2015-01-27 23:08:34	vypr	My stepdad used to be on my side and now he might as well just fuck off.
2015-01-27 23:08:42	liesard	All parents are like that
2015-01-27 23:08:49	liesard	Your mom is probably just stressed because you dropped out
2015-01-27 23:08:57	vypr	Well, yeah, i'd imagine
2015-01-27 23:09:08	 *	xero hugs from a random internet stranger
2015-01-27 23:09:15	vypr	but her comprehension and help would be nice
2015-01-27 23:09:22	vypr	especially when i need it the most right now.
2015-01-27 23:09:34	liesard	Is there someone you can talk to?
2015-01-27 23:09:40	liesard	Like, a friend or something?
2015-01-27 23:09:43	vypr	other than the counselor, it's just you guys
2015-01-27 23:09:52	vypr	and 2 people who I remain in contact with
2015-01-27 23:09:59	liesard	Have you spoken to them?
2015-01-27 23:10:02	vypr	1 of those people who doesn't help, but will just listen
2015-01-27 23:10:10	liesard	And the other?
2015-01-27 23:10:22	vypr	and 1 who won't help since he doesn't like getting involved in things.
2015-01-27 23:10:50	liesard	Oh, man
2015-01-27 23:11:13	vypr	he usually just says "oh well, you fucked up"
2015-01-27 23:11:27	liesard	Well it isn't wrong :P
2015-01-27 23:11:27	vypr	ugh
2015-01-27 23:11:32	vypr	i know
2015-01-27 23:11:33	liesard	But there are so many possibilities for you
2015-01-27 23:11:46	vypr	but there's just no one to help me
2015-01-27 23:11:51	vypr	i know
2015-01-27 23:11:51	liesard	This is your chance to pursue something that your school was limiting you
2015-01-27 23:11:54	liesard	to
2015-01-27 23:11:56	vypr	i just can't do it alone
2015-01-27 23:12:06	vypr	and i'm pretty alone right now
2015-01-27 23:12:08	liesard	I want to say "You have us" but that...
2015-01-27 23:12:13	liesard	That doesn't sound very helpful
2015-01-27 23:12:24	vypr	you guys are the only thing i can get help and advice from
2015-01-27 23:12:27	vypr	other than the counselor
2015-01-27 23:12:36	vypr	mom doesn't listen
2015-01-27 23:12:41	vypr	stepdad can fuck off
2015-01-27 23:12:51	vypr	friends listen but don't help
2015-01-27 23:13:12	vypr	now there's an ever bigger deduction of friends now that I've dropped out
2015-01-27 23:13:22	liesard	Go out and meet some more people
2015-01-27 23:13:25	vypr	dammit
2015-01-27 23:13:26	liesard	Do you have any hobbies?
2015-01-27 23:13:37	vypr	other than programming and video producing, no
2015-01-27 23:13:45	vypr	and meeting peoplle isn't viable for me.
2015-01-27 23:13:49	liesard	How so?
2015-01-27 23:13:54	vypr	no transportation
2015-01-27 23:13:58	vypr	no money for public transit
2015-01-27 23:14:05	vypr	and plus i have social anxiety
2015-01-27 23:14:08	vypr	i don't like talking to people
2015-01-27 23:14:59	liesard	Ah I see
2015-01-27 23:15:03	vypr	and people in my age group around here are mostly fucked up
2015-01-27 23:15:03	liesard	Yeah, that poses a problem
2015-01-27 23:15:10	liesard	Damn...
2015-01-27 23:15:20	vypr	and of course, my mom wouldn't let me hang out with people out of my age group
2015-01-27 23:15:24	vypr	so thats fun
2015-01-27 23:15:51	liesard	Try hanging out with people that are older than you
2015-01-27 23:15:54	liesard	Ok, that sounds weird
2015-01-27 23:16:02	liesard	But, do you see what I mean?
2015-01-27 23:16:07	vypr	yeah

2015-01-27 23:17:00	vypr	she was the only teacher i cared about
2015-01-27 23:17:03	vypr	since she was relatable
2015-01-27 23:17:12	vypr	she sent me a voicemail today
2015-01-27 23:17:19	liesard	What did it say?
2015-01-27 23:17:20	vypr	telling me to turn in a project so I'd pass English
2015-01-27 23:17:27	vypr	but I'm dropped out as of now
2015-01-27 23:17:30	vypr	so it doesn't matter.
2015-01-27 23:17:36	vypr	i just want her to know
2015-01-27 23:17:40	vypr	because maybe she can help
2015-01-27 23:18:12	liesard	Yeah
2015-01-27 23:18:20	liesard	English teachers always seem to be the nicest people
2015-01-27 23:18:24	liesard	It's weird
2015-01-27 23:19:15	vypr	My English teacher was the one who drove me to doing a persuasive speech on internet privacy
2015-01-27 23:20:30	vypr	so, how are you guys?
2015-01-27 23:20:39	liesard	Wait
2015-01-27 23:20:46	liesard	That was /you/, right?
2015-01-27 23:20:50	liesard	The one with the posters?
2015-01-27 23:20:53	vypr	yeah
2015-01-27 23:20:56	vypr	that project is thrown out the window
2015-01-27 23:21:01	liesard	D:
2015-01-27 23:21:02	liesard	Noooooo
2015-01-27 23:21:17	liesard	Can't you hand it down to someone else at least?
2015-01-27 23:21:33	vypr	i don't know anyone who equally cares about that stuff like i do
2015-01-27 23:21:53	vypr	anyways
2015-01-27 23:21:58	liesard	It's important though
2015-01-27 23:22:00	liesard	Anyway, yeah
2015-01-27 23:22:04	liesard	You can go watch NetFlix
2015-01-27 23:22:06	vypr	tl;dr i feel scared and alone
2015-01-27 23:22:12	vypr	i'm not gonna watch netflix
2015-01-27 23:22:21	vypr	it was just something to do while i was eating
2015-01-27 23:22:27	vypr	i'm just watching youtube
2015-01-27 23:23:17	liesard	You should start a project
2015-01-27 23:23:19	liesard	I'll help you with it
2015-01-27 23:23:27	liesard	What languages do you know?
2015-01-27 23:23:31	xero	i agree english teachers are usually nice. but i'm biased. my mom was one ;D
2015-01-27 23:23:42	liesard	Hahahaha
2015-01-27 23:23:55	vypr	Golang, some C, Python (but i never use it, its kinda dumb)
2015-01-27 23:24:00	vypr	I know web design
2015-01-27 23:24:06	liesard	Do you know PHP?
2015-01-27 23:24:06	xero	i also agree w/ liesard, you should pour yourself into a new project. to keep you mind from dwelling on things.
2015-01-27 23:24:10	vypr	no
2015-01-27 23:24:16	vypr	i've always wanted to learn though
2015-01-27 23:24:18	liesard	Learn PHP
2015-01-27 23:24:22	liesard	Let's make a forum!
2015-01-27 23:24:27	liesard	Bring back the real meaning of HTTP
2015-01-27 23:24:28	xero	it's easy.
2015-01-27 23:24:29	vypr	because i wanted to make a dashboard kinda thing
2015-01-27 23:24:36	vypr	what would be better
2015-01-27 23:24:42	vypr	Node.JS for it or PHP?
2015-01-27 23:24:52	vypr	since something like http://mean.io sounds pretty fun
2015-01-27 23:24:53	mcp	Title: MEAN.IO - MongoDB, Express, Angularjs Node.js powered fullstack web framework (at mean.io)
2015-01-27 23:24:54	xero	php is simpler than javascript
2015-01-27 23:25:05	liesard	vypr: PHP
2015-01-27 23:25:07	liesard	I don't like JS
2015-01-27 23:25:14	vypr	Y'know. I could make a forum or something in Golang.
2015-01-27 23:25:21	vypr	Kinda like how jmbi is doing with the new unixpr0n site.
2015-01-27 23:25:24	xero	js is an odd language. but i program in it every day
2015-01-27 23:25:47	liesard	vypr: I wanted to use Go for my forum, but PHP is just so easy to implement
2015-01-27 23:26:04	vypr	I thought PHP was difficult to learn
2015-01-27 23:26:12	vypr	but i'm willing to learn
2015-01-27 23:26:19	vypr	do you know any resources to learn?
2015-01-27 23:26:23	vypr	otherwise i'll just look around
2015-01-27 23:26:26	liesard	Nope
2015-01-27 23:26:33	liesard	Trial+error
2015-01-27 23:26:35	liesard	Best method
2015-01-27 23:26:36	liesard	:P
2015-01-27 23:26:45	vypr	i still want to understand a bit
2015-01-27 23:27:00	liesard	Ah, yeah, then don't do trial and error :P
2015-01-27 23:27:07	xero	dont listen to him, there are tons of great php resources
2015-01-27 23:27:13	xero	let me send you my fav book
2015-01-27 23:27:25	vypr	thanks
2015-01-27 23:28:02	vypr	is PHP as bad as people say?
2015-01-27 23:28:17	liesard	Yeah, it sucks
2015-01-27 23:28:17	vypr	and are frameworks like Laravel and etc nice to have or unneeded?
2015-01-27 23:28:22	xero	http://it-ebooks.info/book/1060/

2015-01-27 23:28:30	xero	this is a great intro book for learners
2015-01-27 23:28:30	vypr	thanks
2015-01-27 23:28:41	liesard	I don't know about frameworks, but I'm sure vanilla PHP is just fine
2015-01-27 23:29:09	xero	php is a language built on top of c. so whatever you write in php is translated into c and run.
2015-01-27 23:29:17	vypr	ooh
2015-01-27 23:29:19	liesard	I did not know that
2015-01-27 23:29:25	xero	it doesn't have strict typing either, so it's easy to mess things up
2015-01-27 23:29:56	xero	$x = "hello"; $x++; 
2015-01-27 23:30:13	xero	php will try and decide what number "hello" is and still increment it
2015-01-27 23:30:18	vypr	heh
2015-01-27 23:30:23	xero	and since it's a string, not a number (nan) it will = 1
2015-01-27 23:30:36	xero	which is dumb in most peoples opinions.
2015-01-27 23:30:58	xero	but it's totally possible to write great php code. lots of people do/
2015-01-27 23:31:36	xero	it
2015-01-27 23:31:57	xero	it's possible to write procedural or object orented code in php, which i think makes is more flexable.
2015-01-27 23:32:19	xero	most people see that as a weakness since there's now "rules" to how you use it.
2015-01-27 23:32:24	xero	*no
2015-01-27 23:32:31	liesard	I heard OOP in PHP is really bad
2015-01-27 23:32:54	xero	you heard wrong. it's a full implementation
2015-01-27 23:33:09	liesard	Oh, Ok
2015-01-27 23:33:22	xero	but it's easy to mess up, since it's got loose typing and no strict coupling
2015-01-27 23:33:33	liesard	I see
2015-01-27 23:33:39	xero	people want a language to "hold their hands" and tell them when they do things wrong
2015-01-27 23:34:01	xero	php was not designed as an oop lang, so it's kind of a hack
2015-01-27 23:34:21	xero	but php 5.5+ works really well
2015-01-27 23:34:30	vypr	xero: what's your thoughts on stuff like Facebook's Hack and the HHVM stuff
2015-01-27 23:34:32	vypr	just curious
2015-01-27 23:34:41	xero	it's a really cool idea
2015-01-27 23:34:56	xero	and if you're doing high volume stuff it's MUCH faster
2015-01-27 23:35:08	xero	since you do compile it then run it as c code
2015-01-27 23:35:18	xero	not php converted to c code on the fly every time
2015-01-27 23:35:38	xero	i dont like that you have to learn a new meta lang to use it though.
2015-01-27 23:35:48	xero	i mean, you dont HAVE to, but to get the most out of it you do
2015-01-27 23:36:13	vypr	ah
2015-01-27 23:36:14	vypr	thanks
2015-01-27 23:36:21	xero	np dude :D
2015-01-27 23:36:44	vypr	i already have a webserver running on my VPS, so I'll do my learning on there
2015-01-27 23:36:53	xero	give it a whirl. it's pretty simple to get started
2015-01-27 23:36:54	vypr	maybe i'll do something with golang too
2015-01-27 23:37:07	vypr	I just have lighttpd on it right now
2015-01-27 23:37:22	vypr	but is MySQL still secure?
2015-01-27 23:37:23	xero	thats fine. the apache stuff in that book it more setup
2015-01-27 23:37:28	vypr	since i heard stuff about it a while ago.
2015-01-27 23:37:43	xero	it's a seemless transition to mariadb
2015-01-27 23:37:52	xero	the new linux standard
2015-01-27 23:37:55	vypr	is that the best option?
2015-01-27 23:38:04	xero	maria is nice
2015-01-27 23:38:23	vypr	what would you use?
2015-01-27 23:38:32	vypr	(just to get some recommendation)
2015-01-27 23:38:54	xero	xero.nu runs on php, mariadb, and apache
2015-01-27 23:39:01	vypr	alrigh
2015-01-27 23:39:03	vypr	alright*
2015-01-27 23:39:03	xero	so that is my stack ;D
2015-01-27 23:39:15	xero	i do nodejs + nginx at work
2015-01-27 23:39:24	xero	i really have mixed feeling about it
2015-01-27 23:39:49	liesard	A guy I know uses MySQL+Apache2+PHP
2015-01-27 23:39:57	liesard	And his site runs pretty smoothly
2015-01-27 23:39:59	vypr	i really wish i had another monitor
2015-01-27 23:40:11	vypr	not enough space to have a web browser, pdf viewer, and term windows open
2015-01-27 23:40:19	vypr	actually
2015-01-27 23:40:26	vypr	let me do a tmux session
2015-01-27 23:40:41	vypr	wait nvm, that won't help.
2015-01-27 23:40:52	liesard	:P
2015-01-27 23:41:14	xero	what wm do you use?
2015-01-27 23:41:20	vypr	swm/wmutils

2015-01-28 11:14:24	liesard	What's up?
2015-01-28 11:14:46	liesard	Hey, is there much of a difference between 1080p and 720p anime?
2015-01-28 11:14:46	mort	not much
2015-01-28 11:14:54	mort	uh idk
2015-01-28 11:14:58	liesard	Ok
2015-01-28 11:15:03	liesard	Thanks :3
2015-01-28 11:15:22	mort	the same differnce as 1080p vs 720p everywhere I'd assume?
2015-01-28 11:15:39	liesard	Yeah, but I think someone mentioned that anime was never 'truly' 1080p
2015-01-28 11:15:48	liesard	I don't really remember what they meant by that though
2015-01-28 11:15:54	mort	why would it not be 1080p?
2015-01-28 11:16:06	mort	that literally makes no sense
2015-01-28 11:16:13	liesard	I have no idea
2015-01-28 11:16:51	mort	btw, I made a thing

2015-01-28 11:17:05	liesard	Oh, cool
2015-01-28 11:17:06	mort	I got annoyed that gifsound.com looks like absolute garbage
2015-01-28 11:17:18	liesard	Wait, what does this do?
2015-01-28 11:17:28	mort	lets you add sounds to gifs
2015-01-28 11:17:40	mort	for example,http://gs.mort.coffee/#i.imgur.com/OMeHkpD.gif;XaHarYdJ2O8

2015-01-28 11:18:27	liesard	How does it work?
2015-01-28 11:18:38	mort	(that gif was in /r/wtf, someone said something like "that's metal", so I added metal sound to it)
2015-01-28 11:19:04	liesard	Hahahaha
2015-01-28 11:20:44	mort	it just it's really simple actually; there's some client side javascript which splits the hash (the part after the #) by ;, adds the part before the ; to an img tag, and adds youtube.com/things?v=(id)etc. to a hidden iframe, where (id) is the part after the ;

2015-01-28 11:23:08	XVII	that's good, it means bot have yet to take over
2015-01-28 11:23:19	mort	ye
2015-01-28 11:23:41	XVII	mort: have you checked the filesystem? sometimes its that
2015-01-28 11:24:07	liesard	Normally you don't need a filesystem for dd though
2015-01-28 11:24:14	liesard	Also, hi XVII 
2015-01-28 11:24:21	XVII	hi liesard :)
2015-01-28 11:24:23	mort	generally, I just install an installer to one USB and boot from that, then tell the installer to install to the other USB
2015-01-28 11:24:32	mort	then the other USB becomes a bootable USB stick
2015-01-28 11:24:48	mort	for some reason though, that doesn't work with this stick
2015-01-28 11:25:23	mort	I can boot from it, but I'm just showed a busybox

2015-01-28 11:35:20	mort	not even kidding, whether or not I can educate myself in comp sci is entirely dependant on whether or not I know a lot about religion and history

2015-01-28 18:36:02	tnecniv	liesard: what subject of math?
2015-01-28 18:36:10	liesard	tnecniv: It's just Maths in general
2015-01-28 18:36:14	+z3bra	(well, not enough in fact, as I missed my graduation :P)

2015-01-28 18:39:07	+z3bra	not sure how it's called in english
2015-01-28 18:39:16	liesard	What is it in French?
2015-01-28 18:39:16	+z3bra	So I just translate word by word

2015-01-28 18:40:00	+z3bra	It's mostly about choppers

2015-01-28 18:40:08	+z3bra	(in electronics)
2015-01-28 18:40:18	liesard	Ah, Ok
2015-01-28 18:40:25	+z3bra	which are basically AC/DC convertors and such
2015-01-28 18:40:47	liesard	Oh, right
2015-01-28 18:40:47	+z3bra	anyway, they gave me a second chance to repass them all until june this year
2015-01-28 18:40:54	liesard	Aren't they called transformers?
2015-01-28 18:41:02	+z3bra	that's another thing
2015-01-28 18:41:09	liesard	Oh, Ok
2015-01-28 18:41:10	tnecniv	z3bra: my uni doesnt offer a course on that, which was really annoying when i had a project where i needed to teach some basic power conversion stuff to myself
2015-01-28 18:41:17	+z3bra	I already succeeded at two of them
2015-01-28 18:41:21	tnecniv	took a month to get the circuit right
2015-01-28 18:41:24	liesard	z3bra: Do you actually need these exams?
2015-01-28 18:41:29	liesard	I mean, you already have a good job
2015-01-28 18:41:40	+z3bra	there's only one remaining, and if I manage, they'll give me my diploma
2015-01-28 18:42:02	liesard	Well then it's probably worth it :P
2015-01-28 18:42:06	liesard	Which one is it?
2015-01-28 18:42:30	+z3bra	liesard, nobody does the same job for his entire life anymore
2015-01-28 18:42:43	liesard	Yeah, but you have the experience and everything
2015-01-28 18:43:03	+z3bra	but some companies just look at your diplomas
2015-01-28 18:43:10	liesard	Oh, Ok
2015-01-28 18:43:11	+z3bra	it also help to get paid more
2015-01-28 18:43:16	liesard	True, yeah
2015-01-28 18:43:17	tnecniv	z3bra: unless you are ajapanese
2015-01-28 18:43:20	+z3bra	sure
2015-01-28 18:43:23	+z3bra	but I'm not
2015-01-28 18:43:31	tnecniv	of course
2015-01-28 18:43:42	+z3bra	anyway, this diploma has nothing to do with sysadmin :P
2015-01-28 18:43:51	tnecniv	my only concern is that i might want to go get a PhD
2015-01-28 18:43:53	+z3bra	(maybe the networking part)
2015-01-28 18:44:00	liesard	z3bra: So what do you want to do?
2015-01-28 18:44:09	liesard	I mean, you're not planning on becoming a sysadmin forever
2015-01-28 18:44:10	+z3bra	net and sysadmin
2015-01-28 18:44:13	liesard	Oh, Ok
2015-01-28 18:44:16	+z3bra	why not ?
2015-01-28 18:44:19	tnecniv	and my GPA is not representative of my knowledge because i didnt put in the work to ensure I got some As in easy classes
2015-01-28 18:44:32	liesard	Well you mentioned that people don't want the same job forever
2015-01-28 18:44:40	liesard	But you can have different jobs but do the same thing
2015-01-28 18:44:49	+z3bra	by that, I mean that you don't stay in the same company
2015-01-28 18:44:55	tnecniv	i'm getting food
2015-01-28 18:44:57	tnecniv	i will be back

2015-01-28 18:46:06	+z3bra	anyways
2015-01-28 18:47:06	fayesafe	i guess sys and netadmin is of the most stable jobs in it

2015-01-29 12:46:40	mort	:P
2015-01-29 12:46:46	fayesafe	try removing the for-loop and just hardcode the parameters
2015-01-29 12:46:55	liesard	I did, but that didn't work
2015-01-29 12:46:55	mort	I already have a server though, and I kinda need this laptop because school
2015-01-29 12:46:59	liesard	Hold on, let me try it again
2015-01-29 12:47:07	liesard	mort: Have you considered buying the battery again?
2015-01-29 12:47:10	mort	I already have a much better laptop which I usually use, but we're not allowed to use our own laptops at school fro some reason
2015-01-29 12:47:17	sbrg	wut
2015-01-29 12:47:17	sbrg	that fucking sucks
2015-01-29 12:47:20	mort	agreed
2015-01-29 12:47:36	bajr	or getting the school to buy the battery?
2015-01-29 12:47:43	liesard	fayesafe: Yeah, still doesn't work
2015-01-29 12:47:45	sbrg	during exams here, we have to run a java applet that monitors everything we do during exams.. 
2015-01-29 12:47:47	sbrg	it's made in-house
2015-01-29 12:47:48	mort	I would have to buy the battery myself

2015-01-29 12:49:44	fayesafe	your class has no constructor
2015-01-29 12:49:53	fayesafe	but i am not sure if thats the reason
2015-01-29 12:50:13	liesard	Well it worked before, but I'm going to try calling the method from the Window class
2015-01-29 12:50:57	fayesafe	i don't understand that sentence
2015-01-29 12:51:26	liesard	Like, even when I didn't call the paintComponent() method, the lines were still drawn
2015-01-29 12:51:34	liesard	Which is kinda strange
2015-01-29 12:51:45	liesard	So now I'm going to call panel.paintComponent() in Window.java
2015-01-29 12:52:17	fayesafe	you don't need to call the paintComponent() method
2015-01-29 12:52:23	liesard	Ok...
2015-01-29 12:52:30	liesard	Why not?
2015-01-29 12:52:37	ymbx	lel, was reading an entire 200% autismo sobstory on reddit. At the end "I am autistic", now I feel kinda bad.
2015-01-29 12:53:06	fayesafe	liesard: and your not setting any attributs of your panel
2015-01-29 12:53:38	fayesafe	paintPlace = new Panel(); paintPlace.setBounds() etc
2015-01-29 12:53:52	liesard	Oh, Ok...

2015-01-29 12:54:47	liesard	Ew, no
2015-01-29 12:54:54	EmperorDAZ_LX	GTK?
2015-01-29 12:55:02	liesard	I heard GTK sucks
2015-01-29 12:55:04	EmperorDAZ_LX	it's in C
2015-01-29 12:55:16	EmperorDAZ_LX	heh, I never made a GUI in my life
2015-01-29 12:55:16	liesard	I'm just trying to do a simple problem
2015-01-29 12:55:19	ymbx	liesard: just do it in QT
2015-01-29 12:55:28	mort	writing the app as a CLI app and then interfacing it with a GUI written in python or something doesn't sound too bad
2015-01-29 12:55:31	EmperorDAZ_LX	but I'd love to learn to do it in Qt
2015-01-29 12:55:41	EmperorDAZ_LX	Qt looks nice
2015-01-29 12:55:45	liesard	This thing is basically done, I just don't know why nothing is being drawn
2015-01-29 12:56:01	fayesafe	still not?
2015-01-29 12:56:07	mort	Qt requires C++ and its own preprocessor afaik
2015-01-29 12:56:09	ymbx	"basically done" == only will take another decade
2015-01-29 12:56:09	liesard	Well it should be, that's the thing
2015-01-29 12:56:18	liesard	Hold on, I'll just copy the code from another thingy I made
2015-01-29 12:56:21	fayesafe	have you changed your code?
2015-01-29 12:56:26	mort	my current project was "basically done" many months ago.
2015-01-29 12:56:53	liesard	fayesafe: I've reverted it to what it was when it worked
2015-01-29 12:56:57	liesard	But it still doesn't...
2015-01-29 12:56:58	ymbx	mort: ;)

2015-01-29 12:57:41	mort	problem*
2015-01-29 12:57:46	mort	the problem is that you're using jvaa.

2015-01-29 13:31:35	thang	mort, yeah they were, but I think they're universal ones
2015-01-29 13:31:56	mort	I only have --enable-*
2015-01-29 13:32:21	mort	but there's an --enable-x11grab, so it may seem like what brew calls "with", the configure file calls "enable"
2015-01-29 13:34:33	mort	let's see if things die if I try to add literally all the enable arguments there are
2015-01-29 13:34:45	thang	http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=configure;h=80985cbc701643630a68e87429d9db529ff2376a;hb=HEAD

2015-01-29 13:34:55	thang	That's basically the configure file itself
2015-01-29 13:35:36	mort	lots of --enable-*, no --with-*
2015-01-29 13:35:52	thang	Yeah, --"with" is a brew thing, not the configure file thing
2015-01-29 13:36:33	thang	I'd enable gpl, version3, nonfree, shared, etc
2015-01-29 13:36:33	mort	k, in theory I'm configuring with all enables except for --enable-cross-compile
2015-01-29 13:36:53	mort	ohey, a header file not found
2015-01-29 13:37:01	thang	then in "external library support", everything you possibly can
2015-01-29 13:37:20	thang	so basically, every single enable line, unless you have an enable line that doesn't let you compile somehow :p
2015-01-29 13:37:36	sbrg	wow
2015-01-29 13:37:39	sbrg	xinerama is gay
2015-01-29 13:37:40	mort	such as --enable-cross-compile :P
2015-01-29 13:37:48	mort	how so sbrg?
2015-01-29 13:38:03	mort	never used it, so I'm curious to hear
2015-01-29 13:38:06	sbrg	it doesn't let you actually draw to a certain xinerama screen. It just tells you where the 'fake' screens start and end
2015-01-29 13:38:19	mort	that sounds odd
2015-01-29 13:38:38	sbrg	that is, you can't pass a 'xinerama screen' to any of the x11 functions that take a screen, say to draw on it. you just get info about where they start and end, x/y coordinates
2015-01-29 13:38:49	thang	lol
2015-01-29 13:38:50	sbrg	so I just have to manually figure out where stuff needs to be drawn and adjust the coordinates..
2015-01-29 13:38:55	mort	:/
2015-01-29 13:39:00	sbrg	dmenu is doing this as well
2015-01-29 13:39:05	sbrg	i'm looking at their code to figure this out
2015-01-29 13:39:51	mort	thang: it's telling me DeckLinkAPI.h doesn't exist

2015-01-29 14:04:46	thang	liesard,it's imgur, it detects image type by its type, not extension
2015-01-29 14:04:55	liesard	I know
2015-01-29 14:05:00	thang	you should be able to use https://i.imgur.com/xJ72403.penis just fine as well
2015-01-29 14:05:05	liesard	I thought it was weird though
2015-01-29 14:05:15	thang	damnit, that one doesn't work ;-;
2015-01-29 14:05:16	liesard	omg
2015-01-29 14:05:23	liesard	Oh, no, it returns 404 :P
2015-01-29 14:05:56	thang	Anyway, mort, apparently the library is for streaming MPEG-2 and DV
2015-01-29 14:06:28	mort	kinda weird that it complains that it doesn't exist even after apt-get installing it though
2015-01-29 14:06:37	thang	Try installing: linavc1394
2015-01-29 14:06:41	thang	both lib and devel
2015-01-29 14:06:54	liesard	Or dev if you're on Debian-based distros
2015-01-29 14:07:12	thang	he's ubuntu, but yes thanks for correction. I forget distros differ like that sometimes :p
2015-01-29 14:07:31	mort	there is nothing linavc-related in my apt repos
2015-01-29 14:07:38	mort	apt-cache search linavc returns nothing
2015-01-29 14:08:03	liesard	thang: :3
2015-01-29 14:08:14	liesard	mort: You mean libavc?
2015-01-29 14:08:30	bajr	kek
2015-01-29 14:08:31	mort	oh, thang must've typo'd
2015-01-29 14:08:34	liesard	Hahahaha
2015-01-29 14:08:44	liesard	I have libavc1394 or here
2015-01-29 14:08:46	liesard	*on
2015-01-29 14:08:50	liesard	But I'm using pacaur
2015-01-29 14:08:58	mort	it's in apt-get too
2015-01-29 14:09:36	liesard	Cool
2015-01-29 14:09:39	liesard	Install it
2015-01-29 14:10:06	mort	done, trying configure again to see what other libs I'm missing
2015-01-29 14:10:23	mort	it's annoying that configure just stops once it finds a lib you've not installed instead of giving you a nice list
2015-01-29 14:10:46	mort	this time it's libaacplus >= 2.0.0
2015-01-29 14:11:01	liesard	ikr
2015-01-29 14:11:07	liesard	But some people add a dependencies file
2015-01-29 14:11:15	liesard	And there is a special place in heaven for all of those people
2015-01-29 14:11:25	mort	ya
2015-01-29 14:11:52	liesard	:3
2015-01-29 14:11:55	mort	but that's kinda hard when you can't know what dependencies exist without knowing the options you'll compile with :P

2015-01-29 14:12:33	thang	horey sheit
2015-01-29 14:12:49	thang	I don't think I typoed, because I copied and pasted that from a developer on ffmpeg :p
2015-01-29 14:12:51	thang	but anyway, meh
2015-01-29 14:12:53	bajr	core: dependancy-name and then some-option: dependancy-name2
2015-01-29 14:12:58	mort	there was a libaacs-dev in my apt repos, but that isn't what ffmpeg wants
2015-01-29 14:13:15	thang	recording in ffmpeg with ffvhuff vs with the defaults is massive...
2015-01-29 14:13:16	mort	any clue what libaacplus >= 2.0.0 is in?
2015-01-29 14:13:19	bajr	so you can use grep to get the list you need
2015-01-29 14:13:19	thang	like 500x larger filesize :p
2015-01-29 14:13:40	bajr	thang: dayum
2015-01-29 14:13:48	bajr	that's kind of a shitty codec
2015-01-29 14:13:50	mort	what does ffvhuff do?
2015-01-29 14:14:00	mort	oh it's a codec?
2015-01-29 14:14:07	thang	It's a codec that's lossless quality
2015-01-29 14:14:26	mort	I see
2015-01-29 14:14:32	mort	500x larger file size makes sense then :P
2015-01-29 14:15:30	thang	intra frame-only, lossless compression, video format, encoding/decoding supported
2015-01-29 14:15:46	thang	I'm also using a bitrate of 2,000
2015-01-29 14:15:57	mort_	That's a high bitrate
2015-01-29 14:16:39	mort_	Though where can I find libaacplus? And how can I figure out where to find the various libs?
2015-01-29 14:16:51	thang	libaacplus?
2015-01-29 14:17:14	mort_	Googling "ubuntu [thing configure claims is missing]" has been a poor strategy so far
2015-01-29 14:17:22	thang	sudo apt-get -y install autoconf automake build-essential libass-dev libfreetype6-dev libgpac-dev \
2015-01-29 14:17:24	thang	  libsdl1.2-dev libtheora-dev libtool libva-dev libvdpau-dev libvorbis-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-shm0-dev \
2015-01-29 14:17:26	thang	  libxcb-xfixes0-dev pkg-config texi2html zlib1g-dev
2015-01-29 14:17:31	thang	run all of that shit and see if you're still missing anything
2015-01-29 14:17:52	mort_	Alright, will do soon
2015-01-29 14:18:17	mort_	I'm currently locked out of the classroom, couldn't bring the laptop because battery
2015-01-29 14:18:41	ymbx	thang: do you know anything about mpi?
2015-01-29 14:19:31	mort	back in front of laptop
2015-01-29 14:22:23	mort	thang: all those are already installed
2015-01-29 14:23:06	mort	it still claims libaacplus >= 2.0.0 is missing
2015-01-29 14:23:18	liesard	Hey guys, anyone here know C/C++ ?
2015-01-29 14:23:32	mort	a little
2015-01-29 14:23:46	thang	they're all installed? weird
2015-01-29 14:24:02	thang	ymbx, Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computers
2015-01-29 14:24:11	thang	Other than that, I don't know a whole lot about it
2015-01-29 14:24:32	liesard	Ok, then nevermind
2015-01-29 14:24:36	thang	oh cool
2015-01-29 14:24:57	thang	And I have rudimentary knowledge of C/C++, but I wouldn't call myself an expert in any way shape or form
2015-01-29 14:25:07	liesard	Ok, well if you can
2015-01-29 14:25:14	liesard	Can you tell me what's wrong with  this: http://pbin.in/brainfuck ?
2015-01-29 14:25:16	mcp	Title: brainfuck (at pbin.in)
2015-01-29 14:25:17	mort	I implemented linked lists and vectors in C, and started implementing hash maps
2015-01-29 14:25:22	liesard	It doesn't display any characters
2015-01-29 14:25:24	mort	oh, and I also implemented brainfuck in it once
2015-01-29 14:25:33	thang	So MPI is a standard definition of a small list of library routines written in like Fortran, C, C++, etc
2015-01-29 14:25:39	thang	oh and Java for whatever reason
2015-01-29 14:25:59	liesard	Oh, cool
2015-01-29 14:26:04	thang	But since the standard is defined for, well, consistently for all of them, you can hook up thousands of computers together and assume they're all running the same library of functions
2015-01-29 14:26:04	liesard	Didn't know that
2015-01-29 14:26:20	liesard	Wow
2015-01-29 14:26:38	mort	hmm
2015-01-29 14:26:39	thang	But here's the best part
2015-01-29 14:26:49	thang	since you're just passing messages, it doesn't matter how you achieve the result as long as it's accurate
2015-01-29 14:27:01	liesard	This can't be good
2015-01-29 14:27:08	thang	which allows them to optimize for every type of hardware and cpu architecture configuration known to man while prserving integrity of the data
2015-01-29 14:27:35	liesard	omg that's beautiful
2015-01-29 14:27:49	thang	e.g. "pass a message of x format containig the sum of a+b...", who cares how the computer got the answer, all you care about is the answer
2015-01-29 14:28:08	thang	hence the functions (by nature) become lockless and embarrassingly parallel and can be run on thousands of computers at once without comprimising the data integrity
2015-01-29 14:28:34	thang	Or, to put it in another way, functional programming before it was cool :p
2015-01-29 14:28:52	liesard	That is amazing
2015-01-29 14:28:57	liesard	Wait, so why don't we use this?
2015-01-29 14:29:01	thang	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface
2015-01-29 14:29:02	mcp	Title: Message Passing Interface - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
2015-01-29 14:29:04	thang	We do use it, all the time
2015-01-29 14:29:10	liesard	Oh
2015-01-29 14:29:25	liesard	What for?
2015-01-29 14:29:30	vypr	hi m80s
2015-01-29 14:29:35	thang	How do you think super computers work?
2015-01-29 14:29:43	liesard	Hi vypr 
2015-01-29 14:29:48	liesard	thang: Ooooooh
2015-01-29 14:29:49	thang	It's one buliding with 2 million CPUs hooked together
2015-01-29 14:29:50	liesard	I see
2015-01-29 14:30:08	thang	Essentially, it's two million different computers working in parallel through MPI (I believe)
2015-01-29 14:30:20	liesard	Riiight, I see
2015-01-29 14:30:32	liesard	Do people also use that for servers?
2015-01-29 14:30:37	liesard	Like, because there are so many
2015-01-29 14:30:38	thang	As for mort's question... let's see. Any issues with compiling so far?
2015-01-29 14:30:47	thang	yeah, it's great for servers
2015-01-29 14:30:58	liesard	Nice
2015-01-29 14:31:06	liesard	vypr: How's your NEET-ness going? ;D
2015-01-29 14:31:13	thang	Whenever you get something to an embarrassingly parallel state, it means you can slice the problem into an almost infinite amount of sub-steps and have them all executed without regard for order
2015-01-29 14:31:19	mort	thang: I'm following https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/How%20to%20quickly%20compile%20libaacplus
2015-01-29 14:31:20	mcp	Title: How to quickly compile libaacplus – FFmpeg (at trac.ffmpeg.org)
2015-01-29 14:31:25	mort	should in theory work
2015-01-29 14:31:39	thang	That's how GPUs work. You have a few million pixels, and it dosn't matter to pixel number 500 what pixel number 3 is
2015-01-29 14:32:07	liesard	Ooooh, I see
2015-01-29 14:32:08	thang	so you can just segment the monitor into hundreds of small chunks and divvy them all up to the hundreds of cores in your GPU that are all optimized for floating point operations
2015-01-29 14:32:15	liesard	That's smart
2015-01-29 14:32:38	thang	Then they implement something similar to MPI so the cores can communicate with each other and say stuff like "hey, this ball is gonna head in your direction, I'd start loading some data now" 
2015-01-29 14:32:45	vypr	liesard: I just have to go to my old school today to get my transcript, report card, and state test records today
2015-01-29 14:32:55	vypr	remove the 2nd today
2015-01-29 14:33:01	vypr	anyways, after that, I'm done

2015-01-29 14:33:41	liesard	When do you know you'll get your online classes?
2015-01-29 14:33:49	liesard	Like, when do they accept you?
2015-01-29 14:34:00	vypr	i'd imagine after i've given all the compliancy items
2015-01-29 14:34:12	vypr	they can't put me into 11th grade without a transcript

2015-01-29 14:34:47	vypr	yep

2015-01-29 15:13:06	mort	can ffmpeg record directly to webm?
2015-01-29 15:13:35	liesard	I think so, yeah
2015-01-29 15:13:46	mort	why aren't you doing that?
2015-01-29 15:13:52	thang	I am?
2015-01-29 15:14:14	thang	I'm recording directly to mkv and directly to webm at the same time using two different codecs simultaneously
2015-01-29 15:14:50	mort	huh, I see
2015-01-29 15:14:54	liesard	WebM and mkv were made by the same people
2015-01-29 15:15:46	mort	though won't that first record mkv with ffmpeg, and when that's done, and if the command returned with exit code 0, record the webm with ffmpeg?
2015-01-29 15:19:20	mort	thang
2015-01-29 15:20:12	thang	idk
2015-01-29 15:20:13	thang	it worked for me
2015-01-29 15:20:28	thang	I ran the command with both simultaneousy  and it gave me both with the exact same times and everything
2015-01-29 15:20:36	mort	as long as it works :P
2015-01-29 15:23:05	thang	if you wanna take a compile time hit
2015-01-29 15:23:47	bajr	with pipes, you could make a cli app and a frontend for it and use it with 'cli | gui'
2015-01-29 15:23:51	bajr	it would work asynchronously
2015-01-29 15:23:56	sbrg	you guys using ffmpeg to record gifs?
2015-01-29 15:23:59	thang	yeah
2015-01-29 15:24:02	sbrg	or, well, webm/mkv
2015-01-29 15:24:05	thang	 #hardcoreLikeDat
2015-01-29 15:24:21	thang	But anyway, if you take the compile time hit, you can just record in pure mkv and then convert later

2015-01-29 15:41:50	thang	first argument is name of file. If you don't have a second argument it records the screen in webm and mkv at the same time
2015-01-29 15:42:03	thang	if you have an argument of 1, it'll do the same as above (aka first option)

2015-01-29 16:02:13	vypr	i would torrent on my VPS
2015-01-29 16:02:17	vypr	but DigitalOcean may have a fit

2015-01-29 16:02:22	thang	sorry, was reading backlog
2015-01-29 16:02:28	thang	you guys get really freaky whenever I go afk and start doing shit
2015-01-29 16:02:28	thetornainbow	i use feralhosting for seedbox
2015-01-29 16:02:39	thetornainbow	they're fantastic, host from the Netherlands
2015-01-29 16:02:47	sbrg	i have ~90mbit
2015-01-29 16:02:49	liesard	I just have a server at home
2015-01-29 16:02:52	sbrg	so I can torrent at home just fine
2015-01-29 16:02:52	liesard	On which I opened the ports
2015-01-29 16:02:54	ymbx	thang: can you help me with this? https://i.imgur.com/rDnOyDR.png
2015-01-29 16:03:13	liesard	So I can stream wherever I want~
2015-01-29 16:03:14	ymbx	I know the answers, but I don't know why?
2015-01-29 16:03:22	thang	What are the answers?
2015-01-29 16:03:44	vypr	heh
2015-01-29 16:03:49	ymbx	thang: 18 and 3
2015-01-29 16:03:55	thang	I'm pretty sure I know them, but I wanna make sure we start off on the same page and all that :p
2015-01-29 16:03:55	vypr	they're arresting this hillbilly
2015-01-29 16:04:04	vypr	wearing a shirt that says "shit happens"
2015-01-29 16:04:10	vypr	he can't speak english properly
2015-01-29 16:04:14	liesard	Hahahahaha
2015-01-29 16:04:16	thang	Well, critical path length is the easy one
2015-01-29 16:04:22	liesard	Yeah, you need something good to watch
2015-01-29 16:04:32	thang	Task one executes, and THEN you can execute task 4, and THEN task 5
2015-01-29 16:04:53	thang	so say you want to execute task 5... You have to start from task 1 -> 4 -> 5
2015-01-29 16:05:03	thang	That's the longest time period possible for the path
2015-01-29 16:05:27	thang	So if your system has a critical path length of 18, you can guarantee that all operations will take place in 18 or less units of time
2015-01-29 16:05:29	vypr	what the fuck
2015-01-29 16:05:29	ymbx	but you need to execute T2 and T3 also?
2015-01-29 16:05:33	vypr	this guy is making a speech
2015-01-29 16:05:55	sbrg	T1 T2 and T3 can be executed concurrently. Those are the maximum amount of tasks that can be executed concurrently because of the dependency graph. 
2015-01-29 16:05:59	thang	Well, yes, but task 1 and 2 don't depend on each other
2015-01-29 16:06:13	thang	same for 3 and 4
2015-01-29 16:06:14	liesard	Ok, I'm off to my next lesson
2015-01-29 16:06:18	liesard	Have fun, guys~

2015-01-30 19:46:24	oog	i did

2015-01-30 19:46:28	liesard	Oh :|
2015-01-30 19:46:34	oog	damn. I thought so.
2015-01-30 19:46:35	fro	also probably better to not use a DM
2015-01-30 19:46:42	fro	because it's a fucking hassle
2015-01-30 19:46:44	oog	DM? Desktop manager?
2015-01-30 19:46:44	liesard	fro: Yeah, but he'll have to get to the tty thingy to use startx first

2015-01-30 19:46:47	liesard	oog: Yeah
2015-01-30 19:46:58	oog	because unity uses x11 not startx

2015-01-30 19:47:04	liesard	That's different
2015-01-30 19:47:07	liesard	And no
2015-01-30 19:47:09	oog	oh.
2015-01-30 19:47:12	oog	dang it.
2015-01-30 19:47:12	liesard	startx is a command to start X11
2015-01-30 19:47:17	liesard	And every DM uses it
2015-01-30 19:47:21	liesard	And every WM uses it
2015-01-30 19:47:35	oog	if your using x11 doesnt that mean initrc is not used?
2015-01-30 19:47:43	liesard	Kinda
2015-01-30 19:47:55	liesard	.xinitrc is a configuration file that runs when you run startx
2015-01-30 19:48:21	liesard	If you're using a graphical display manager, which you are, then you won't need .xinitrc
2015-01-30 19:48:45	liesard	X11 is what allows keyboard input, mouse input and graphical display thingys on the screen
2015-01-30 19:48:48	oog	That was what i was trying to say. 
2015-01-30 19:48:58	oog	I'm tryin!

2015-01-30 19:50:12	fro	waste of time
2015-01-30 19:50:14	oog	Can i disable unity in initrc?
2015-01-30 19:50:18	liesard	Yes
2015-01-30 19:50:18	fro	just stop using the DM
2015-01-30 19:50:26	liesard	^
2015-01-30 19:50:28	fro	and use startx
2015-01-30 19:50:29	liesard	But it's kinda complicated
2015-01-30 19:50:33	liesard	Ok, it uses lightdm
2015-01-30 19:50:36	oog	Challenge accepted.
2015-01-30 19:50:44	mort	I think maybe adding "swm" or whatever the command is to .Xinitrc makes ubuntu automatically use that instead of the magical graphical thing it usually uses
2015-01-30 19:50:54	oog	i believe it is.
2015-01-30 19:50:58	liesard	mort: Nope
2015-01-30 19:51:08	mort	:)

2015-01-30 19:53:04	oog	because i did that.
2015-01-30 19:53:14	mort	you won't see anything graphical
2015-01-30 19:53:17	liesard	Yeah
2015-01-30 19:53:20	mort	you'll likely be met with a CLI

2015-01-30 19:53:38	oog	brb
2015-01-30 19:53:39	mort	then you can `echo "swm" > .Xinitrc` and `startx`
2015-01-30 19:53:59	liesard	Or just vi .xinitrc and edit it manually
2015-01-30 19:54:09	oog	Thats what i had planned on doing.

2015-01-31 18:53:27	liesard	Hey guys, I have a serious problem
2015-01-31 18:53:36	liesard	I think I misphrased that
2015-01-31 18:53:39	liesard	Anyway
2015-01-31 18:53:50	liesard	Whenever I open a terminal emulator, no text appears

2015-01-31 18:54:19	liesard	ikr :P
2015-01-31 18:54:22	liesard	There were a bunch of errors with X.org/X/X11 but they all seemed unrelated
2015-01-31 18:54:46	mort	have you tried another terminal emulator?
2015-01-31 18:54:53	liesard	I don't have one installed
2015-01-31 18:55:02	mort	install one
2015-01-31 18:55:17	liesard	Ok
2015-01-31 18:55:21	liesard	Is sed Ok?
2015-01-31 18:55:38	mort	uh, isn't sed not a terminal emulator?
2015-01-31 18:55:55	liesard	?????
2015-01-31 18:56:07	liesard	Wait, shit, I'm thinking of something else
2015-01-31 18:56:12	liesard	That one that suckless made
2015-01-31 18:56:18	mort	oh
2015-01-31 18:56:25	mort	rxvt-unicode should work at least
2015-01-31 18:56:29	liesard	Oh shit, you're right
2015-01-31 18:56:38	liesard	Yeah, I use urxvt normally, but it didn't work
2015-01-31 18:56:46	mort	oh
2015-01-31 18:56:49	liesard	Which is weird as hell, and is a weird-ass hell
2015-01-31 18:56:51	mort	try gnome-terminal?

2015-01-31 20:05:04	ymbx	because most literary books are full of unnecessary bullshit
2015-01-31 20:05:54	ymbx	e.g. "John entered the blue-painted room, which had a vase looking like it was made in the second world war. The vase remembered him of his grandmother, who died in the war. blablabla"
2015-01-31 20:06:20	ymbx	I can't even read shit like that anymore.
2015-01-31 20:06:35	mort	would you rather have it read "John entered the room."

2015-01-31 20:11:06	ymbx	liesard: talking to me?
2015-01-31 20:11:20	liesard	Yeah, I thought you wrote that list of books
2015-01-31 20:11:22	liesard	But it was mort
2015-01-31 20:12:22	ymbx	I liked the movies, lel.
2015-01-31 20:12:50	ymbx	mort: "John entered the room" is only boring if the story is shit.
2015-01-31 20:12:57	ymbx	which, for a lot of books, is true
2015-01-31 20:13:06	liesard	Yeah, but the LotR and Harry Potter books are long and  boring
2015-01-31 20:13:22	liesard	Especially LotR because it's old and even Tolkein got bored of it at the end
2015-01-31 20:13:22	ymbx	I like books where the text is to-the-point, but the story is engaging.
2015-01-31 20:13:33	mort	I liked them
2015-01-31 20:13:37	liesard	Read The Wasp Factory
2015-01-31 20:13:42	liesard	Just read it
2015-01-31 20:13:44	liesard	No questions
2015-01-31 20:13:46	ymbx	Most literary books seem of the kind long-and-drawn-out-bullshit-with-a-shit-story.
2015-01-31 20:14:04	liesard	I only managed to read half of it before people around me got worried
2015-01-31 20:14:07	liesard	'cause it's about crazy people
2015-01-31 20:14:10	liesard	But basically yeah
2015-01-31 20:14:11	liesard	Read it
2015-01-31 20:14:47	mort	oh, and
2015-01-31 20:14:49	mort	I've read the room
2015-01-31 20:14:54	mort	that was a nice read too
2015-01-31 20:15:13	ymbx	liesard: why would I read it?
2015-01-31 20:15:33	mort	why would people get worried because you're reading a book about crazy people?
2015-01-31 20:15:36	liesard	ymbx: Because it's not boring, to the point and has an interesting story
2015-01-31 20:15:45	liesard	mort: Because there was a slight chance that I was crazy
2015-01-31 20:15:47	liesard	I'm not, though
2015-01-31 20:16:35	ymbx	meh
2015-01-31 20:16:44	mort	what kind of crazy?
2015-01-31 20:16:56	liesard	The main character killed three people
2015-01-31 20:17:12	liesard	One of them was because "there could be only one"
2015-01-31 20:17:15	mort	I mean, what kind of crazy was there a slight chance that you were
2015-01-31 20:17:19	liesard	Oh, Ok
2015-01-31 20:17:23	liesard	I dunno
2015-01-31 20:17:34	liesard	Just the fact that I kept talking about all the ways I could kill people and all the people I could kill
2015-01-31 20:17:42	mort	I see
2015-01-31 20:17:43	liesard	And the teachers and my parents got seriously concerned
2015-01-31 20:17:55	mort	you should watch hannibal
2015-01-31 20:18:02	mort	it's related
2015-01-31 20:18:10	liesard	I know
2015-01-31 20:18:14	liesard	But a girl I hate watches it
2015-01-31 20:18:16	liesard	So I'll pass on that
2015-01-31 20:18:21	mort	what
2015-01-31 20:18:24	ymbx	I watch it too.
2015-01-31 20:18:32	ymbx	It's a really good show.
2015-01-31 20:18:34	mort	do you also pass on oxygen because the girl you hate breathes it
2015-01-31 20:18:42	mort	or maybe you pass on pizza because she likes eating pizza
2015-01-31 20:18:46	liesard	No, but it makes me think of her
2015-01-31 20:18:58	liesard	And I don't want to keep thinking of the girl I hate whenever I'm trying to enjoy something
2015-01-31 20:19:08	mort	why do you hate her?
2015-01-31 20:19:24	liesard	She's just being herself
2015-01-31 20:19:28	ymbx	he got friendzoned hard m8
2015-01-31 20:19:35	liesard	Fuck off
2015-01-31 20:19:37	ymbx	and now he resents her
2015-01-31 20:19:46	ymbx	see? he's still resentful
2015-01-31 20:19:52	%xero	ymbx: read the count of monte cristo
2015-01-31 20:21:15	ymbx	xero: liesard: there are probably a few good literary books. I just meant to say that the bulk of them is cancer, not all.
2015-01-31 20:21:43	liesard	They're not cancer though
2015-01-31 20:21:48	liesard	They're just not to your liking
2015-01-31 20:22:33	mort	not to ymbx' liking === cancer
2015-01-31 20:22:58	ymbx	well, I think so, because what the hell is the point of a hugely drawn-out story that includes a lot of shit non-relevant to the story?
2015-01-31 20:23:12	ymbx	mort: that's not true
2015-01-31 20:23:12	liesard	Well don't call it fucking cancer
2015-01-31 20:23:41	liesard	Call it "boring and not to my liking"
2015-01-31 20:24:27	ymbx	I dunno. Do you call a movie like "The son of the mask" or "avatar: tla" also "boring and not to my liking" or do you call it cancer?
2015-01-31 20:24:44	mort	ATLA the TV show is amazing
2015-01-31 20:25:00	liesard	ymbx: I do, actually
2015-01-31 20:25:00	ymbx	yeah, I mean the movie
2015-01-31 20:25:21	liesard	Because I don't call things cancer
2015-01-31 20:25:31	liesard	I articulate what I didn't like about things that I don't like
2015-01-31 20:25:48	ymbx	oh, you find the word cancer itself offensive (used in this context) ?
2015-01-31 20:25:56	rocx	Does cancer trigger you?
2015-01-31 20:26:02	liesard	No
2015-01-31 20:26:05	liesard	I just think it's unfit
2015-01-31 20:27:39	%xero	i was just saying based on the book you liked, here's another you may enjoy
2015-01-31 20:28:26	ymbx	xero: ill keep it in mind, but I have developed such a strong dislike to reading that i dunno if ill ever read any literary book again
2015-01-31 20:29:42	ymbx	liesard: are there any people that actually enjoy reading those kinds of books?
2015-01-31 20:29:47	liesard	Probably
2015-01-31 20:29:53	ymbx	because if there are, then I probably shouldn't call it cancer
2015-01-31 20:29:58	liesard	There's every kind of person in the world
2015-01-31 20:30:05	arianon	ymbx: there are people who enjoy literally eating shit
2015-01-31 20:30:18	ymbx	yeah, okay, but I mean aside from the crazy ones
2015-01-31 20:30:22	rocx	People into scat, maybe.;
2015-01-31 20:30:32	ymbx	I mean a sizeable portion, like 10+%
2015-01-31 20:31:06	liesard	Yeah, definitely
2015-01-31 20:31:24	liesard	I mean, it wasn't until the 70s or something when books really started being fast-paced
2015-01-31 20:31:40	liesard	So of course there's a significant portion of the population who enjoys slow-paced books
2015-01-31 20:33:46	ymbx	hmm, okay
2015-01-31 20:34:00	ymbx	well, okay then, I won't call it cancer
2015-01-31 20:35:16	liesard	Cool

2015-02-01 16:39:42	XVII	ymbx: i've never seen that function, but if that's the doc and your api is different i dont know, have you tried looking at the signature of the one you use?
2015-02-01 16:39:45	liesard	I have a question
2015-02-01 16:39:56	XVII	like in the header 
2015-02-01 16:40:00	ymbx	i dont know what a signature is
2015-02-01 16:40:08	liesard	Is it possible to use mpd across networks?
2015-02-01 16:40:20	liesard	Like, say I'm not at home

2015-02-01 16:40:45	XVII	ymbx: a signature of a function is like the "interface"
2015-02-01 16:40:55	XVII	wait with examples is better
2015-02-01 16:41:06	XVII	int MPI_Sendrecv(const void *sendbuf, int sendcount, MPI_Datatype sendtype,

2015-02-01 16:41:31	XVII	so, in the .h file
2015-02-01 16:41:34	rocx	Quick question about program design: I'm making a program that says the time similar to a QLOCK but without the grid. Would that be better off having the program fetch the system time or as a filter and have whatever script send the `date` to it?
2015-02-01 16:41:36	XVII	you should have the one you use
2015-02-01 16:41:55	ymbx	I dont have any .h files
2015-02-01 16:42:07	ymbx	you mean "mpi.h" ?
2015-02-01 16:42:07	XVII	you dont include mpi.h?
2015-02-01 16:42:10	XVII	yeh

2015-02-01 16:43:22	ymbx	oh, fuck, I forgot MPI_Comm comm and MPI_Status *status
