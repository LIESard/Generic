2015-01-27 20:56:59	DesertRock	Does it have to be green? I'm partial to a toned down brownish red
2015-01-27 20:57:11	wzl	no green is essential for a successful project
2015-01-27 20:57:16	wzl	it signalises hope

2015-01-27 20:57:35	rxi	DesertRock, you use red rectangles for mobs and things-that-kill-you

2015-01-27 20:59:41	rxi	DesertRock, lol, no I mean like, the benefit is when you get to the particle effects and stuff, where you might accidentally leave in the small yellow-orangeish sparks and your mind will sort of, ignore that they don't fit the style of the game

2015-01-27 21:50:21	rnlf	rxi, what do you mean?
2015-01-27 21:50:50	rxi	rnlf, when certain software assumes it can just use a gigabyte of ram and assumes thats fine, though it doesn't seem entirely justified that it would.. or things like ubuntu's menu bar taking up like 300mb of ram, like seems totally unjustified
2015-01-27 21:51:29	rnlf	rxi, oh yeah. my gf's eeepc can barely run ubuntu anymore. had to show her how to use xfce
2015-01-27 21:51:30	rxi	like I'm fine if Rage or something takes 8 gbs of ram, but why is a menu bar with like 4 icons on it taking like 300
2015-01-27 21:51:55	rnlf	rxi, but to be fair, it's probably just 300M of address space, not actual 300M of physical memory

2015-01-27 21:54:43	rxi	and I'm happy to miss out on certain things, erm like, things that seem like they'd so obviously need a massive amount of ram, but then you have like... a text editor taking up half a GB, or chrome swapping every time you start it but then 1080p video playing fine, and it feels like I dunno, certain software is just made badly
2015-01-27 21:54:56	DesertRock	Got the map, time to figure out how to collide
2015-01-27 21:55:03	mentaldemon	Wing, came up with that riff today :D
2015-01-27 21:55:11	liesard	rxi: Yeah, that happens a lot
2015-01-27 21:55:13	liesard	It's ridiculous
2015-01-27 21:55:18	liesard	DesertRock: Collision detection is easy
2015-01-27 21:55:22	liesard	But the collision itself isn't
2015-01-27 21:55:47	DesertRock	liesard: yeah, I'll figure it out :>
2015-01-27 21:55:47	rxi	like if 1080p video didn't work that'd make more sense as a thing "old hardware can't do", but when its a menu bar or a text editor it like, I can't think of any other reason besides someone being stupid or lazy
2015-01-27 21:56:44	liesard	DesertRock: :D
2015-01-27 21:57:04	rxi	its mostly fine, though, like lots of choice in terms of software, and you just avoid the troublesome things, but it does bring home like how odd it is when you have actual practical running examples of basically the same piece of software but not taking a GB of ram
2015-01-27 21:57:07	@sorceress	rxi, most will wrongly blame their hardware for being inadequate, rather than the software being badly made 
2015-01-27 21:57:16	DesertRock	I could look at how rxi did it, but that would be very slow ;)
2015-01-27 21:57:41	liesard	rxi: There is a lot of software which is poorly made
2015-01-27 21:57:58	liesard	The problem is that it's hard to make certain things
2015-01-27 21:58:08	liesard	For example, browsers have to take up a lot of memory
2015-01-27 21:58:13	liesard	Otherwise it will lack features
2015-01-27 21:58:31	mentaldemon	features like not being able to take up memory
2015-01-27 21:58:33	rxi	sorceress, yeh, its bad all round. liesard additionally, while I'm on my rant: I hate this stupid trivial shit people moan about, like using a linear search instead of a hash table when there are only 100 items, and it taking like an unmeasurable amount of time to run
2015-01-27 21:58:43	rxi	and people will *freak out* about it
2015-01-27 21:59:01	liesard	rxi: You know, suckless had the same stance as you
2015-01-27 21:59:04	liesard	You know what they did?
2015-01-27 21:59:10	liesard	They wrote their own software
2015-01-27 21:59:19	rxi	and its like, can you concentrate on the software that uses 300mb of ram to show 4 icons rather than my software that takes 2 pico seconds to start up rather than 1
2015-01-27 21:59:50	rxi	liesard, yeh it seems.. mainly fine, like enough alternatives that it isn't an *issue*, but it just seems such a backwards attitude people have
2015-01-27 22:00:05	mentaldemon	rxi, whatcha think of elite dangerous? game itself was 15 gb ish... but there are 400 billion star systems to explore
2015-01-27 22:00:15	liesard	rxi: Yeah, that's definitely true
2015-01-27 22:00:33	liesard	But pretty much everything technology-related on the consumer side is going to shit
2015-01-27 22:00:41	liesard	Wait, I don't think that's the right expression
2015-01-27 22:00:44	liesard	Anyway, it's really bad
2015-01-27 22:00:54	rxi	mentaldemon, I've no issue for that kind of stuff, that game looks amazing -- like things that seem like it *should* take up gigabytes. Its things that shouldn't take up such a massive amount of resources (eg, a text editor)
2015-01-27 22:01:09	liesard	And people are trying to fix it with things like Wayland and IPv6 but it's just not easy
2015-01-27 22:01:15	liesard	And it's not easy to convince everyone to change

2015-01-27 23:32:16	deniska	I am more interested who thought to use shaking a window as an accelerometer mock? =)
2015-01-27 23:32:18	obskyr	Does Lua have anything like `from x import *`?
2015-01-27 23:32:46	obskyr	To not store the module in a variable, but rather just dump everything in the local scope where it's required.
2015-01-27 23:33:50	awsumpwner27	Pretty sure require just does that.
2015-01-27 23:34:19	obskyr	Does it?
2015-01-27 23:34:46	deniska	no
2015-01-27 23:34:54	obskyr	Doesn't `require("thing")` put everything defined in `thing` in a new table?
2015-01-27 23:34:59	obskyr	I'm fairly certain it does.

2015-01-27 23:35:22	obskyr	So you've automatically got things like `thing.doThing()` instead of just `doThing()`.
2015-01-27 23:35:43	deniska	well
2015-01-27 23:35:56	deniska	if inside a thing.lua you have global things, you will have global things

2015-01-27 23:36:23	obskyr	They're so... global.
2015-01-27 23:36:42	wzl	comments on the positioning/structure?
2015-01-27 23:36:43	obskyr	Maybe it's not always bad practice, though.
2015-01-27 23:36:50	obskyr	Might actually be useful for my purposes.
2015-01-27 23:37:05	awsumpwner27	Oh, local scope.
2015-01-27 23:37:21	awsumpwner27	Yes, Lua is very global-y.
2015-01-27 23:37:36	obskyr	Maybe I should just embrace it.
2015-01-27 23:38:00	obskyr	Plus, I guess in LÖVE it's just plain useful to have things like the game object and input manager be global.
2015-01-27 23:38:08	jonASS_lund	wzl: tilemap editor ?
2015-01-27 23:38:14	wzl	jonASS_lund, yes
2015-01-27 23:38:23	wzl	i wanna redesign the ui
2015-01-27 23:38:35	awsumpwner27	I dunno what's in the spec, but the standard implementation actually has a limit on the number of global variables you can have in a script.
2015-01-27 23:38:42	awsumpwner27	It's like 250.

2015-01-27 23:39:13	obskyr	That's a bit less scary, but still scary in a different way.
2015-01-27 23:39:13	deniska	obskyr: lua's "use strict": setmetatable(_G, {__newindex=function (t, v) print("Undefined: " .. v); exit() end})
2015-01-27 23:39:15	jonASS_lund	wzl: what's the difference between "tiles" and tilematrix ?
2015-01-27 23:39:29	wzl	its mostly huge and takes up too much space or overlapswith the level
2015-01-27 23:39:44	wzl	tiles show your tiling tools, brush, area, copy, eraser
2015-01-27 23:40:00	wzl	tilematrix is a history of selected tiles
2015-01-27 23:40:06	wzl	to quickly pick from them if desired
2015-01-27 23:40:15	wzl	the tilesheet is not in there yet
2015-01-27 23:40:27	wzl	will probably go to the bottom right, but that wastes so much space ;/
2015-01-27 23:40:36	obskyr	deniska: Don't know how relevant that is, but might be useful, I guess.
2015-01-27 23:40:40	jonASS_lund	wzl: I'd get rid of that bottom section altogether
2015-01-27 23:40:54	jonASS_lund	wzl: have a right bar, split it in 2 sections
2015-01-27 23:41:07	wzl	thats what i had before
2015-01-27 23:41:11	jonASS_lund	you want that vertical space on a widescreen monitor (most laptops are)
2015-01-27 23:41:25	wzl	i figured horizontal space is more important for level editing
2015-01-27 23:41:29	jonASS_lund	wzl: was that "config" on the left side always visible ?
2015-01-27 23:41:40	jonASS_lund	depends on the sort of game though ?
2015-01-27 23:41:48	wzl	both sections can be collapsed actually
2015-01-27 23:42:11	jonASS_lund	what was the biggest problem ?

2015-02-01 11:33:27	Wonkyth	hey Jeviny 
2015-02-01 11:33:29	Wonkyth	how's liff?
2015-02-01 11:33:35	Jeviny	gid
2015-02-01 11:33:57	Jeviny	My game is almost done, right now I'm just playtesting.
2015-02-01 11:34:09	Jeviny	By the way, this game is a fucking bitch to playtest all the way through because it's almost impossible
2015-02-01 11:34:25	Jeviny	like, there's about a 5% to 7% chance that you'll be able to beat this game
2015-02-01 11:34:53	Jeviny	I made it fucktardedly difficult to fit the ragequit theme
2015-02-01 11:35:01	wzl	if you wanted to make a fair game you shouldnt have made a runner x)
2015-02-01 11:35:02	Jeviny	I'm trying to reach for as many themes, goals and limitations as I can this MiniLD, its nuts
2015-02-01 11:35:14	Jeviny	I never wanted to make a fair game. ;)
2015-02-01 11:35:32	Jeviny	Platformers are the same thing as runners anyways
2015-02-01 11:35:37	Jeviny	its just that you choose when you get to move

2015-02-01 11:40:36	gingerale	Hmm.. Was thinking.. I believe my favourite video game story moment is from a Legend of Zelda game. That part in Twilight Princess where Midna is close to death and you're dropped in the field stuck in wolf form.

2015-02-01 11:41:43	Wonkyth	hmm
2015-02-01 11:42:12	Wonkyth	I think mine is when [spoiler] is [spoilered] by the [spoiler]
2015-02-01 11:42:17	Wonkyth	in To The Moon :P
2015-02-01 11:42:19	gingerale	You start rushing through everything in order to save your companion. And the game doesn't even force you to a direction. It didn't drop you in front of the castle or anything but rather the field. There's no timer, you could start running to any direction. But I've never heard of anyone who would even stop for a moment in order to get to the location you need to go.
2015-02-01 11:42:29	gingerale	Oh yeah, To The Moon is on my to-play list
2015-02-01 11:42:38	Wonkyth	do iiiit
2015-02-01 11:43:50	Wonkyth	gingerale: srs, just set aside an evening some time
2015-02-01 11:44:04	gingerale	Yeh, I'll need to dig it out sometime first
2015-02-01 11:44:30	Wonkyth	lol
2015-02-01 11:47:02	Wonkyth	Wait, when did I get all the Civ V expansions? o.O
2015-02-01 11:47:09	Wonkyth	I mean, I'm not complaining
2015-02-01 11:47:34	Wonkyth	I bought Civ V for 5$, and literally just got 100$+ worth of expansions
2015-02-01 11:47:42	Jeviny	So, it *is* possible to beat my game
2015-02-01 11:47:49	Wonkyth	Jeviny: teh lol
2015-02-01 11:47:49	Jeviny	there's just a very small chance that anybody will be able to do it
