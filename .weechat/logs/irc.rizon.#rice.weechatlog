2015-01-27 22:56:19	@kyubiko	Blurry walls are good because they distract they eye from what you're looking at less

2015-01-27 23:09:30	+esmth	crypto discussions are in /biz/
2015-01-27 23:10:38	JS1	seems like there is a general dislike of bitcoin around here though
2015-01-27 23:10:47	JS1	kinda like tox but tox seems more 50/50
2015-01-27 23:12:07	@kyubiko	was tox a /g/ project?

2015-01-27 23:14:42	JS1	needs adoption in order to be stable imo
2015-01-27 23:14:53	JS1	people have to exchange it for goods rather than usd to keep it stable
2015-01-27 23:15:08	JS1	i think it'll take an app or something to make people use it for that

2015-01-28 11:19:12	oedla	on a <30", not much no
2015-01-28 11:19:17	liesard	My screen is 1920x1080
2015-01-28 11:19:23	liesard	Oh, with size
2015-01-28 11:19:31	liesard	Yeah, it's 13"
2015-01-28 11:19:32	oedla	then go 720p, you won't see much of a difference
2015-01-28 11:19:32	@kyubiko_school	There is
2015-01-28 11:19:46	liesard	kyubiko_school: Is it worth to get 1080p?
2015-01-28 11:20:00	oedla	>13"
2015-01-28 11:20:09	oedla	you can go non-hd and still be good m8
2015-01-28 11:20:18	liesard	How so?
2015-01-28 11:20:43	oedla	tiny screen, unless you're a falcon you won't recognize much difference
2015-01-28 11:20:58	oedla	then again, I'm half blind so maybe it's just me
2015-01-28 11:21:23	+inuoppai	resolution != bitrate
2015-01-28 11:21:32	liesard	oedla: Ah, Ok
2015-01-28 11:21:47	liesard	inuoppai: Where does it specify the bitrate though?
2015-01-28 11:21:48	%Plez	dying light launched on linux from day1, pretty neat
2015-01-28 11:22:28	+inuoppai	liesard: Depends on codec.
2015-01-28 11:22:47	+inuoppai	Just saying just because it's 1080p doesn't make it have better !!quality!!
2015-01-28 11:22:57	liesard	Oh, Ok
2015-01-28 11:23:02	liesard	I see
2015-01-28 11:23:43	liesard	Is there a particular way to stream anime from a server?
2015-01-28 11:23:50	liesard	Right now I just upload the files and watch it through mpv
2015-01-28 11:27:00	@kyubiko_school	If you have good internet, and it's not just an upscale go 1080p
2015-01-28 11:27:40	+inuoppai	Streaming is not as bad as /a/ makes it sound.
2015-01-28 11:27:51	+inuoppai	... it was pretty fucking horrible at one pointl.
2015-01-28 11:27:53	+inuoppai	But that's history
2015-01-28 11:29:33	liesard	kyubiko_school: Yeah, but I don't have a good internet connection
2015-01-28 11:29:43	liesard	That's why I asked about the difference between 1080p and 720p
2015-01-28 11:30:58	liesard	Wow
2015-01-28 11:31:11	+onodera	1080 does look much better imo
2015-01-28 11:31:24	liesard	It does, but it's not always worth it
2015-01-28 11:31:28	liesard	I mean, in the end they're drawings

2015-01-28 11:31:35	+onodera	especially on anime such as steins;gate that use lots of grain
2015-01-28 11:31:45	liesard	True, yeah
2015-01-28 11:31:51	liesard	I guess it depends on the anime?
2015-01-28 11:32:43	liesard	I mean, with Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou there isn't really a difference
2015-01-28 11:32:49	liesard	At least, from what I've seen
2015-01-28 11:34:00	@kyubiko_school	Idk if bokura got a blu ray release, might just be upscaled
2015-01-28 11:34:13	@kyubiko_school	I only have 720p version
2015-01-28 11:34:33	liesard	Yeah, that might be it
2015-01-28 11:34:59	liesard	But there wasn't really much of a difference
2015-01-28 11:35:12	liesard	And now it doesn't take 5 fucking hours to load 20 minutes of anime
2015-01-28 11:35:18	@kyubiko_school	Lol
2015-01-28 11:35:43	liesard	It's not /that/ much better now
2015-01-28 11:36:08	liesard	The only thing is that mpv stops buffering after ~12MB
2015-01-28 11:36:22	liesard	Like, as soon as 12M has been loaded, mpv stops loading more
2015-01-28 11:37:18	@kyubiko_school	Think you can increase buffer size in config file
2015-01-28 11:37:36	liesard	omg

2015-01-28 11:39:15	liesard	Is the cache what gets loaded?
2015-01-28 11:39:18	liesard	Or is that something else?
2015-01-28 11:39:32	arianon	the cache is the amount of video that is loaded in the memory, in bytes
2015-01-28 11:39:45	@kyubiko_school	Yeah
2015-01-28 11:39:52	liesard	Thanks!
2015-01-28 11:40:48	liesard	So why does it get stopped?
2015-01-28 11:41:06	liesard	Like, what's the purpose of it not buffering?
2015-01-28 11:41:27	@kyubiko_school	Cache gets full I'd guess?
2015-01-28 11:41:47	arianon	^
2015-01-28 11:42:01	arianon	let's assume that for some reason you want unlimited cache
2015-01-28 11:42:05	liesard	Yeah...
2015-01-28 11:42:10	arianon	that means you load the whole video in the memory
2015-01-28 11:42:15	liesard	Yup

2015-01-28 16:31:27	liesard	It was Ok
2015-01-28 16:31:49	liesard	There was someone on here who asked how to make the channels on weechat correspond with their servers
2015-01-28 16:32:00	liesard	Does anyone remember who that was?
2015-01-28 16:32:05	liesard	I think it was xenkey

2015-01-28 16:37:00	brushy	correspond?
2015-01-28 16:37:32	brushy	like have the channels for a server under the server name?
2015-01-28 16:38:26	liesard	Yeah
2015-01-28 16:38:27	liesard	That
2015-01-28 16:38:41	liesard	'cause I think I figured out how to do it
2015-01-28 16:38:41	brushy	that sounds pretty neat
2015-01-28 16:38:46	brushy	:o
2015-01-28 16:38:48	brushy	please share
2015-01-28 16:39:12	liesard	Well on irc.look.server_buffer, put independent
2015-01-28 16:40:24	liesard	There was a way to make the channels be indented and the servers not
2015-01-28 16:40:27	liesard	But I forgot how
2015-01-28 16:42:03	brushy	just set it to independent and all it did was is add an index number to the servers
2015-01-28 16:42:17	brushy	that actually helps a bit though (:
2015-01-28 16:42:19	brushy	thanks (:
2015-01-28 16:43:27	liesard	Oh :|
2015-01-28 16:43:45	liesard	I know that there's something else, I just forgot what it was :P
2015-01-28 16:44:16	brushy	it's alright, I need to read the docs again anyways
2015-01-28 16:44:24	brushy	thanks though (:
2015-01-28 16:44:53	liesard	Alright!
2015-01-28 16:45:05	liesard	If you ever figure it out, then can you tell me what it is?
2015-01-28 16:45:08	liesard	I'm kinda lazy :P
2015-01-28 16:46:10	brushy	sure! I definitely will do
2015-01-28 16:46:21	liesard	Thanks! :D
2015-01-28 16:46:39	brushy	I'm just about done setting up a vm image of gentoo somebody asked me to set up for them
2015-01-28 16:46:48	brushy	I get free hosting out of these 'favors' so I can't complain
2015-01-28 16:46:59	brushy	I think I forgot to add ssh to the default run level >_>
2015-01-28 16:47:33	brushy	or I accidently set ssh so it doesn't accept root connections
2015-01-28 16:47:38	liesard	:O
2015-01-28 16:47:46	liesard	It's pretty easy to revert it if it's the latter
2015-01-28 16:48:00	liesard	So you have a site or something?
2015-01-28 16:48:16	brushy	yuh although it's a DO droplet at the moment
2015-01-28 16:48:31	brushy	I want to migrate it over to one of the VM's from him

2015-01-28 16:49:25	liesard	Oh, Wordpress

2015-01-28 16:51:54	liesard	Oh, cool
2015-01-28 16:51:57	liesard	Do you think you'll get it?
2015-01-28 16:52:04	liesard	(Also, this is mort's site: http://www.mort.coffee/)
2015-01-28 16:52:39	brushy	probably not, I went for a 'voice admin' job which wants you to have a full on CCNA (i'm working on that atm)
2015-01-28 16:53:00	brushy	I know enough of the VoIP concepts to probably get me by but i'm far far far from experienced
2015-01-28 16:53:16	brushy	tfw nobody wants to hire you because of no experience
2015-01-28 16:53:38	brushy	oh nice, morts site is pretty neat
2015-01-28 16:54:13	liesard	Yeah, experience is what drives the industry :P
2015-01-28 16:54:27	liesard	But you can tell them stuff like you're really willing to learn and such
2015-01-28 16:54:36	liesard	So that they'll hire you AND you'll get experience

2015-01-28 16:55:44	brushy	I honestly think I might make a call to some old friends from the gaming scene and see if they can at least get me an internship
2015-01-28 16:55:53	brushy	some of them have been doing IT/CS jobs for a few years
2015-01-28 16:56:11	brushy	a couple of the guys I know are around 40 so i'll just ask around
2015-01-28 16:56:23	liesard	Yeah, that could work
2015-01-28 16:56:27	liesard	*would
2015-01-28 16:56:41	liesard	I would go for the ISP job first though
2015-01-28 16:56:46	liesard	I mean, if that's really what you want to do
2015-01-28 16:57:21	brushy	the ISP job was one of the few around Australia where I saw, "Linux experience needed"
2015-01-28 16:57:42	brushy	most people I have studied with have very little idea that Linux is only a kernel, yet alone know how to admin anything on it :p

2015-01-29 13:40:17	liesard	????
2015-01-29 13:40:25	arianon	it uses a special kind of JSON for the config files
2015-01-29 13:40:30	liesard	Yeah
2015-01-29 13:40:35	arianon	but for the colorschemes and themes it uses XML
2015-01-29 13:40:39	liesard	Oooh, Ok
2015-01-29 13:41:01	arianon	there probably are some websites where you can create themes
2015-01-29 13:41:13	liesard	Yeah, probably
2015-01-29 13:41:18	liesard	Ugh, I don't want to get into this
2015-01-29 13:41:21	arianon	but sublime's highlighting is some pretty advanced shit, since it uses regular expressions
2015-01-29 13:41:28	liesard	Oh shit
2015-01-29 13:41:33	liesard	But nano does that as well, doesn't it?

2015-01-29 14:01:55	liesard	onodera: 200 words?  It couldn't be that hard...
2015-01-29 14:01:55	arianon	that's 6th grade tier
2015-01-29 14:02:07	liesard	tsune: Nice
2015-01-29 14:02:13	tsune	some relational algebra, then we started dipping our toes in Postgres

2015-01-29 14:05:05	tsune	started using vim a few months ago and I'm not going back to any other editor lel
2015-01-29 14:05:20	tsune	I still have to get the hang of copying text from outside vim but in any case I still like it a lot
2015-01-29 14:05:56	liesard	Nice
2015-01-29 14:06:03	liesard	I never managed to get into vi
2015-01-29 14:06:58	tsune	I didn't like it a lot before, in fact if I had to work in a term I would have used nano
2015-01-29 14:07:11	tsune	but after you learn a few motions and commands it's too hard to go back to another editor
2015-01-29 14:07:34	liesard	Yeah, it's so smooth, but I always forget about them
2015-01-29 14:07:51	liesard	It happens a lot that I delete all the text on a line and then press dd
2015-01-29 14:08:31	tsune	see I didn't learn about DD :P
2015-01-29 14:08:47	tsune	I usually just did C
2015-01-29 14:08:51	tsune	and removed the line manually
2015-01-29 14:09:14	liesard	Hahahaha
2015-01-29 14:10:05	liesard	I sometimes find tutorials on vim and I get worried that they might not work on vi
2015-01-29 14:10:10	liesard	But they normally do
2015-01-29 14:10:18	liesard	Actually, so far they all have
2015-01-29 14:11:12	tsune	why don't you just use vim?
2015-01-29 14:11:13	tsune	instead of vi
2015-01-29 14:11:21	liesard	'cause vi is already installed
2015-01-29 14:11:25	liesard	And I don't even use it that much
2015-01-29 14:12:46	tsune	makes sense

2015-01-29 14:13:53	tsune	I don't know that one

2015-01-29 14:14:14	liesard	Yup
2015-01-29 14:14:20	liesard	That's why I chose to make an interpreter for it
2015-01-29 14:14:25	liesard	'cause it's supposedly easy

2015-01-31 20:56:24	%Plez	i like i3
2015-01-31 20:56:28	liesard	'cause I couldn't figure out tiling

2015-01-31 20:57:32	liesard	Oh yeah, definitely
2015-01-31 20:57:34	%Plez	theres no way to tile efficiently
2015-01-31 20:57:41	%Plez	youre better off minimizing

2015-02-01 16:48:49	tsune	I'm guessing you want us for example to listen to what you have?

2015-02-01 19:09:22	JS1	yellow is the most difficult color

2015-02-01 19:09:48	JS1	i usually end up opting for a more brown color

2015-02-01 19:12:56	tsune	had it before with lemon, turned it off for no special reason now
2015-02-01 19:12:58	liesard	But if I start now I'll be late to school

2015-02-01 19:17:11	JS1	with just $HOME it seems more 'proper'
2015-02-01 19:17:14	liesard	I mean, to get a notification every time a site is down?
2015-02-01 19:18:00	~kori	JS1: I came up with this a while ago
2015-02-01 19:18:09	zxc	JS1: Do you use git ?
2015-02-01 19:18:11	~kori	since I didn't like paths in my shell prompt cuz it was too long
2015-02-01 19:18:14	JS1	also another question, /etc/profile is bash's version, won't that cause problems?

2015-02-01 19:47:18	+onodera	e trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. The general form of the problem is this: There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a
2015-02-01 19:47:20	+onodera	different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. Which is the correct choice?
2015-02-01 19:47:22	%st4g	I refuse to believe anybody here could take a life willingly.
2015-02-01 19:47:30	tsune	I couldn't.

2015-02-01 19:48:59	arianon	the trolley problem is easy, spock describes this as "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few", I'd pull the lever because there would be less fatalities, less amount of grieving families and less amount of pain
