Of all I knew
I held too few
And would you stop me
If I tried to stop you?

Old songs stay till the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way that it is, I could leave it all
And I ask myself: would you care at all?

When I drive alone at night
I see the street lights as fair grounds
And I've tried a hundred times
To see the road signs as day-glo

Old songs stay till the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way that it is, I could leave it all
And I ask myself: would you care at all?

Old songs stay till the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way that it is, I could leave it all
And I ask myself: would you care at all?
