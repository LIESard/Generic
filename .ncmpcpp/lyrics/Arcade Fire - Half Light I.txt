You told us that we were too young
Now that night's closing in and in the half light, we run
Lock us up safe and hide the key
But the night tears us loose and in the half light, we're free

Strange how the half light can make a place new
You can't recognize me and I can't recognize you
We run through these streets that we know so well
And the houses hide so much, we're in the half light
None of us can tell they hide the ocean in a shell, 
the ocean in a shell

Our heads are just houses, without enough windows
They say you hear human voices but they only echo
They only echo, they only echo, only echo

We are not listening, we are on the streets
We are not listening, we are on the streets
We are not asleep, we are on the streets
