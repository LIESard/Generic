Boys and girls wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night, was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowing the cup
About five or six strippers trying to work for a buck
So I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Londi, she went to Junior High with me
I said, "Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last"

She said, "What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor 'cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now, he's just smoking rock now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life"

"Girl you ain't the only one to have a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy"
So she stared me right, square in the eye
And said "Everyday I wake up hoping to die"
She said "They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away so our daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager, I've done been through
More shit you can even relate to"

"What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor 'cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now, he's just smoking rock now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life"

(What would you do?)
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
(What would you do?)
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
(What would you do?)
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
(What would you do?) Get up off my feet...

"What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor 'cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now, he's just smoking rock now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life"
