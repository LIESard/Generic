In the suburbs I, I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys we're leaving

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored, we were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

The kids want to be so hard but in my dreams
We're still screaming and running through the yard
When all of the walls that they built in the Seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the Seventies finally fall
Meant nothing at all? Meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand and show her some beauty
Before all this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass in the parking lot we're still waiting, it's already past
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's already past, it's already, already past

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

I'm moving past the feeling, I'm moving past the feeling

In my dreams we're still screaming
We're still screaming
We're still screaming
